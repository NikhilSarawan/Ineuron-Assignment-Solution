    "Q1. Describe three applications for exception processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-\n",
    "Exception processing in programming languages like Python is a mechanism for handling unexpected or exceptional ,\n",
    "situations that can occur during program execution. Here are three common applications of exception processing:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Error Handling**:\n",
    "   Exception processing is widely used for error handling in programs. When errors occur during the execution ,\n",
    "of a program, they can be caught and handled gracefully using exception handling techniques. For example,\n",
    "when opening a file, if the file does not exist, a `FileNotFoundError` can be raised. Instead of crashing,\n",
    "the program, the code can catch this exception and provide a user-friendly error message, or attempt to ,\n",
    "create the file if it doesn't exist. This ensures that the program can handle unexpected situations without ,\n",
    "terminating abruptly.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   try:\n",
    "       file = open(\"non_existent_file.txt\", \"r\")\n",
    "   except FileNotFoundError:\n",
    "       print(\"File not found. Creating a new file.\")\n",
    "       file = open(\"non_existent_file.txt\", \"w\")\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Input Validation**:\n",
    "   Exception processing is useful for validating user input. For example, if a program expects the user to,\n",
    "input an integer, and the user enters a string, a `ValueError` can be raised. By catching this exception,\n",
    "the program can prompt the user to enter a valid integer, ensuring that the input conforms to the expected format.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   while True:\n",
    "       try:\n",
    "           user_input = int(input(\"Enter an integer: \"))\n",
    "           break\n",
    "       except ValueError:\n",
    "           print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a valid integer.\")\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Resource Management and Cleanup**:\n",
    "   Exception processing is crucial when working with resources that need to be acquired and released properly,\n",
    "such as file handles, network connections, or database connections. For example, when working with files, \n",
    "exceptions can be caught to ensure that the file is closed properly, even if an error occurs during processing.\n",
    "This prevents resource leaks and ensures that resources are cleaned up, regardless of whether an exception was raised.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   try:\n",
    "       file = open(\"example.txt\", \"r\")\n",
    "       # Code to process the file contents\n",
    "   except FileNotFoundError:\n",
    "       print(\"File not found.\")\n",
    "   finally:\n",
    "       # Ensure that the file is closed, even if an exception occurred\n",
    "       file.close()\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "By using exception processing in these and other similar scenarios, programmers can write more robust, \n",
    "fault-tolerant, and user-friendly applications that can handle unexpected situations without crashing\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. What happens if you don&#39;t do something extra to treat an exception?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-\n",
    "\n",
    "If you don't handle an exception in your code, it will propagate up the call stack until it's caught by an ,\n",
    "appropriate exception handler. If no handler is found, the program will terminate, and Python will display,\n",
    "an error message, including information about the unhandled exception, the type of exception, and the ,\n",
    "traceback (the sequence of function calls that led to the exception). This process is known as an \"unhandled exception.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "When an unhandled exception occurs, Python provides a traceback to help you identify the source of the error. \n",
    "This traceback includes the filename, line number, and function calls leading up to the exception. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Traceback (most recent call last):\n",
    "  File \"example.py\", line 7, in <module>\n",
    "    result = 10 / 0\n",
    "ZeroDivisionError: division by zero\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, a `ZeroDivisionError` occurred at line 7 of the `example.py` file. The program attempted to,\n",
    "divide 10 by 0, which is not allowed in Python and raised a division by zero exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "To prevent the program from terminating due to unhandled exceptions, you can use exception handling techniques,\n",
    "such as `try`, `except`, `else`, and `finally` blocks, to catch and handle exceptions appropriately. \n",
    "Handling exceptions allows you to gracefully recover from errors, display meaningful error messages to users,\n",
    "and prevent the program from crashing unexpectedly. If you choose not to handle an exception intentionally, \n",
    "it's important to be aware that your program might terminate unexpectedly when an error occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. What are your options for recovering from an exception in your script?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-\n",
    "\n",
    "When an exception occurs in your Python script, you have several options for recovering from it and preventing,\n",
    "your program from crashing unexpectedly. Here are some common techniques for handling exceptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Using a `try`-`except` Block**:\n",
    "   The `try`-`except` block allows you to catch and handle specific exceptions that might occur within the `try`,\n",
    "block. You can specify the type of exception you want to catch and define how to handle it inside the `except` block.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   try:\n",
    "       # Code that might raise an exception\n",
    "   except SomeSpecificException:\n",
    "       # Handle the specific exception\n",
    "   except AnotherException:\n",
    "       # Handle another specific exception\n",
    "   else:\n",
    "       # Code to execute if no exception occurred\n",
    "   finally:\n",
    "       # Code that will always be executed, whether an exception occurred or not\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Using a Generic `except` Block**:\n",
    "   You can use a generic `except` block to catch any exception that wasn't caught by the specific `except` blocks.\n",
    "  However, using a generic `except` block is generally discouraged because it can catch unexpected exceptions and,\n",
    "  make debugging more difficult.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   try:\n",
    "       # Code that might raise an exception\n",
    "   except Exception as e:\n",
    "       # Handle any exception (not recommended for all cases)\n",
    "       print(f\"An error occurred: {e}\")\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Using `else` Block**:\n",
    "   You can use the `else` block after a `try`-`except` block to specify code that should be executed if no exception\n",
    "   occurred in the `try` block.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   try:\n",
    "       # Code that might raise an exception\n",
    "   except SomeSpecificException:\n",
    "       # Handle the specific exception\n",
    "   else:\n",
    "       # Code to execute if no exception occurred\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Using `finally` Block**:\n",
    "   The `finally` block allows you to specify code that will always be executed, regardless of whether an exception,\n",
    "   occurred or not. It's often used for cleanup operations like closing files or releasing resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   try:\n",
    "       # Code that might raise an exception\n",
    "   except SomeSpecificException:\n",
    "       # Handle the specific exception\n",
    "   finally:\n",
    "       # Code that will always be executed, whether an exception occurred or not\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Raising Custom Exceptions**:\n",
    "   In some cases, you might want to raise custom exceptions to indicate specific error conditions in your code. \n",
    "   You can create your own exception classes by inheriting from the `Exception` class.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   class CustomException(Exception):\n",
    "       pass\n",
    "\n",
    "   try:\n",
    "       # Code that might raise a custom exception\n",
    "       if some_condition:\n",
    "           raise CustomException(\"This is a custom exception\")\n",
    "   except CustomException as e:\n",
    "       # Handle the custom exception\n",
    "       print(f\"Caught a custom exception: {e}\")\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   By using these techniques, you can gracefully recover from exceptions, handle errors, and ensure that your,\n",
    "   program behaves as expected even when unexpected situations occur. Choosing the appropriate method depends,\n",
    "   on the specific requirements and logic of your script.\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "Q4. Describe two methods for triggering exceptions in your script.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, you can trigger exceptions using the `raise` statement. The `raise` statement allows you to,\n",
    "explicitly raise exceptions in your code. Here are two common methods for triggering exceptions in your script:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Raising Built-in Exceptions**:\n",
    "   You can raise built-in exceptions like `ValueError`, `TypeError`, `ZeroDivisionError`, or any other,\n",
    "   exception provided by Python. You can raise these exceptions with an optional error message to provide,\n",
    "   additional context about the exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   def validate_input(value):\n",
    "       if not isinstance(value, int):\n",
    "           raise ValueError(\"Invalid input: must be an integer\")\n",
    "       if value <= 0:\n",
    "           raise ValueError(\"Invalid input: must be a positive integer\")\n",
    "       # Perform some processing with the valid input\n",
    "\n",
    "   try:\n",
    "       user_input = int(input(\"Enter a positive integer: \"))\n",
    "       validate_input(user_input)\n",
    "   except ValueError as e:\n",
    "       print(f\"Error: {e}\")\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   In this example, if the user enters a non-integer or a non-positive integer, a `ValueError` is raised ,\n",
    "   a specific error message.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Raising Custom Exceptions**:\n",
    "   You can create your own custom exceptions by defining a new exception class. Custom exceptions are helpful,\n",
    "   when you want to raise exceptions specific to your application domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   class CustomException(Exception):\n",
    "       def __init__(self, message):\n",
    "           super().__init__(message)\n",
    "\n",
    "   def process_data(data):\n",
    "       if not data:\n",
    "           raise CustomException(\"Empty data: cannot process\")\n",
    "       # Perform processing with the non-empty data\n",
    "\n",
    "   try:\n",
    "       input_data = get_input_data()  # Assume a function to retrieve input data\n",
    "       process_data(input_data)\n",
    "   except CustomException as e:\n",
    "       print(f\"Custom Exception: {e}\")\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   In this example, if the `input_data` is empty, a `CustomException` is raised with a specific error message.\n",
    "\n",
    "   By using the `raise` statement, you can trigger exceptions in specific situations within your code.\n",
    "   This allows you to handle exceptional cases gracefully and provide meaningful error messages to users,\n",
    "   or developers when something unexpected occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. Identify two methods for specifying actions to be executed at termination time, regardless of\n",
    "    whether or not an exception exists.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, you can specify actions to be executed at termination time, regardless of whether or not an,\n",
    "exception exists, using two methods: the `finally` block and context managers (such as the `with` statement).\n",
    "    Both of these methods ensure that certain code is executed, providing a way to handle cleanup operations, \n",
    "    resource releases, or other essential tasks, regardless of whether an exception was raised or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Using the `finally` Block**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   The `finally` block in a `try`-`except` statement allows you to specify code that will always be executed,\n",
    "regardless of whether an exception occurred. It is placed after the `try` and `except` blocks, and the code ,\n",
    "within the `finally` block will run no matter what.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   try:\n",
    "       # Code that might raise an exception\n",
    "   except SomeSpecificException:\n",
    "       # Handle the specific exception\n",
    "   finally:\n",
    "       # Code that will always be executed, whether an exception occurred or not\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   For example, if you're working with files, you can use a `finally` block to ensure the file is closed properly:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   file = None\n",
    "   try:\n",
    "       file = open(\"example.txt\", \"r\")\n",
    "       # Code to process the file contents\n",
    "   except FileNotFoundError:\n",
    "       print(\"File not found.\")\n",
    "   finally:\n",
    "       # Ensure that the file is closed, even if an exception occurred or not\n",
    "       if file:\n",
    "           file.close()\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Using Context Managers (with Statement)**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   Python's `with` statement is used to simplify exception handling and resource management. It provides ,\n",
    "a way to ensure that a resource is acquired and released properly. When a class supports the context ,\n",
    "management protocol (by defining `__enter__` and `__exit__` methods), it can be used with the `with` statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "   For example, working with files, you can use the `with` statement to ensure the file is closed automatically,\n",
    "    after the indented block is executed:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   try:\n",
    "       with open(\"example.txt\", \"r\") as file:\n",
    "           # Code to process the file contents\n",
    "   except FileNotFoundError:\n",
    "       print(\"File not found.\")\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   In this example, the `with` statement takes care of closing the file, whether an exception occurs or not.\n",
    "   The file is automatically closed when the code inside the `with` block is executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both the `finally` block and the `with` statement provide effective ways to handle cleanup operations, \n",
    "ensuring that necessary actions are taken at termination time, regardless of the presence of exceptions. \n",
    "Choose the appropriate method based on your specific use case and preference."
