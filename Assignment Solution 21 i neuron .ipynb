    "    print(birthday)\n",
    "    This code uses the datetime module to create a date object representing my day of birth. The date function takes three,\n",
    "    arguments: the year, month, and day of the date. In this example, I passed in the values 2000, 4, and 1 to represent ,\n",
    "    my birth year, month, and day, respectively.The resulting date object is stored in the birthday variable, and then,\n",

    "##8. What day of the week was your day of birth?\n",
    "     \n",
    "Ans-.To determine the day of the week on which I was born, we can use the weekday() method of the date object in Python. \n",
    "    Here is some code that will do that:\n",
    "        \n",
    "    import datetime\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Create a date object representing my day of birth\n",

    "    # Print the day of the week\n",
    "    print(day_of_week)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    This code creates a date object representing my day of birth, just like in the previous example. Then,\n",
    "    it uses the weekday() method to get the day of the week on which I was born. This method returns an integer ,\n",
    "    representing the day of the week, where Monday is 0 and Sunday is 6. So if the value of day_of_week is 4, for example, \n",
    "    that would mean that I was born on a Friday.\n",
    "\n",
    "    To get the name of the day of the week instead of just the integer value, you can use the strftime() method to format,\n",
    "    the date object. Here is an example:\n",
    "        \n",
    "    import datetime\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Create a date object representing my day of birth\n",

    "\n",
    "    # Print the day of the week\n",
    "    print(day_of_week)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    This code creates a date object representing my day of birth, just like before. Then, it uses the strftime() method to format,\n",
    "    the date object as a string in the format specified by the argument. In this case, %A represents the full name of the day of,\n",
    "    the week, so the resulting string will be something like \"Friday\" or \"Saturday\". resulting string is stored in the,\n",
    "    day_of_week variable and then printed to the console using the print function.\n",

    "    # Print the result\n",
    "    print(ten_thousand_days)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    This code defines my birthdate as a date object, just like in the previous examples. Then, \n",
    "    it uses the timedelta() function from the datetime module to add 10,000 days to my birthdate.\n",
    "    The resulting date object represents the day when I will be or was 10,000 days old. Finally,\n",
    "    the code prints the resulting date object to the console using the print function.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Note that if you're using this code to calculate when you will be 10,000 days old, you'll need to update,\n",
