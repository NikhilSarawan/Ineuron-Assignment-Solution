    "##  1. Why are functions advantageous to have in your programs?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-.Functions are advantageous to have in your programs because they allow you to break down complex tasks into smaller,\n",
    "    more manageable pieces of code. This makes your code easier to understand, debug, and maintain. Functions also promote code\n",
    "    reuse, as you can call the same function multiple times throughout your program with different arguments.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "##  2. When does the code in a function run: when it's specified or when it's called?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-.The code in a function runs when it is called, not when it is specified. When you call a function,\n",
    "     the program jumps to the function definition and executes the code within it.\n",
    "    \n",
    "##  3. What statement creates a function? \n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-.The statement that creates a function in Python is \"def\". For example, \n",
    "     the following code creates a function called \"add_numbers\" that takes two arguments and returns their sum: \n",
    "     def add_numbers(x, y):\n",
    "     return x + y\n",
    "\n",
    "##  4. What is the difference between a function and a function call?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-.A function is a block of code that performs a specific task, while a function call is the code that requests the ,\n",
    "     execution of a function with specific arguments.In other words, a function call is how you use a function in your program.\n",
    "    \n",
    "##  5. How many global scopes are there in a Python program? How many local scopes?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-.There is only one global scope in a Python program, which is where variables that are defined outside of functions reside.\n",
    "    Local scopes are created whenever a function is called and are destroyed when the function returns. \n",
    "    So the number of local scopes depends on how many functions are called in your program.\n",
    "    \n",
    "##  6. What happens to variables in a local scope when the function call returns?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-.When a function call returns, variables in the local scope are destroyed and their values are lost.\n",
    "     Any variables that were defined in the local scope cannot be accessed outside of the function.\n",
    "    \n",
    "##  7. What is the concept of a return value? Is it possible to have a return value in an expression? \n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-.A return value is the value that a function sends back to the code that called it\n",
    "     It is possible to have a return value in an expression, which means that you can use the return value of a function as part,\n",
    "     of a larger expression. For example:\n",
    "     \n",
    "     total = add_numbers(2, 3) * 10\n",
    "    \n",
    "##  8. If a function does not have a return statement, what is the return value of a call to that function?   \n",
    " \n",
    "Ans-.If a function does not have a return statement, the return value of a call to that function is \"None\". \n",
    "     This is a special value in Python that represents the absence of a value. \n",
    "\n",
    "##  9. How do you make a function variable refer to the global variable?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-.To make a function variable refer to a global variable, you can use the \"global\" keyword inside the function.\n",
    "     For example:\n",
    "     x = 10\n",
    "\n",
    "    def my_function():\n",
    "    global x\n",
    "    x = 20\n",
    "\n",
    "    my_function()\n",
    "    print(x) \n",
    "    \n",
    "## 10. What is the data type of None? \n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-.The data type of \"None\" is \"NoneType\". It is a built-in data type in Python that represents the absence of a value.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 11. What does the sentence import areallyourpetsnamederic do?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-.The sentence \"import areallyourpetsnamederic\" is not a valid Python statement and would result in a syntax error.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 12. If you had a bacon() feature in a spam module, what would you call it after importing spam?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-.If you had a \"bacon()\" feature in a \"spam\" module, you would call it like this after importing \"spam\":\n",
    "    \n",
    "    import spam\n",
    "\n",
    "    spam.bacon()\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "## 13. What can you do to save a programme from crashing if it encounters an error?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-.To save a program from crashing if it encounters an error, you can use error handling with a \"try\" and \"except\" block.\n",
    "    This allows you to catch and handle errors gracefully instead of letting them crash the program.\n",
    "    \n",
    "## 14. What is the purpose of the try clause? What is the purpose of the except clause? \n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-.The purpose of the \"try\" clause is to enclose code that may raise an error.\n",
    "    The purpose of the \"except\" clause is to specify the code that should be executed if an error is raised within,\n",
    "    the \"try\" clause. The \"except\" clause allows you to catch and handle specific types of errors, \n",
    "    or to catch all errors using a general exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
