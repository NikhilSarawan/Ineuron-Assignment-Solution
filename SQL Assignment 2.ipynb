    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL provides several aggregate functions that perform calculations on a set of values and return a single value. \n",
    "Here are some common SQL aggregate functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **COUNT**: Counts the number of rows in a set.\n",
    "2. **SUM**: Calculates the sum of values in a set.\n",
    "3. **AVG**: Calculates the average of values in a set.\n",
    "4. **MIN**: Returns the minimum value in a set.\n",
    "5. **MAX**: Returns the maximum value in a set.\n",

    "Let's demonstrate how to use these aggregate functions with a hypothetical \"Orders\" table:\n",

    "    OrderID INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",

    ");\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Insert some sample data\n",
    "INSERT INTO Orders (OrderID, ProductName, Quantity, Price)\n",

    "Now, let's demonstrate the usage of aggregate functions:\n",

    "1. **COUNT** - Count the number of orders:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT COUNT(*) AS TotalOrders FROM Orders;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **SUM** - Calculate the total price of all orders:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT SUM(Price) AS TotalPrice FROM Orders;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **AVG** - Calculate the average quantity of products:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT AVG(Quantity) AS AvgQuantity FROM Orders;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT MIN(Quantity) AS MinQuantity FROM Orders;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT MAX(Price) AS MaxPrice FROM Orders;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "These queries demonstrate the use of SQL aggregate functions to perform calculations on the data in the \"Orders\" table.\n",

    "\n",
    "This query will pivot the data in the `Sales` table to show total sales amounts for each product by month. The `PIVOT`\n",

    "- The `INNER JOIN` clause combines rows from both tables where there is a match on the specified condition\n",
    "(`Students.DepartmentID = Departments.DepartmentID`).\n",
    "- The `ON` keyword specifies the condition for the join.\n",
    "- In this case, we're joining the `Students` table with the `Departments` table based on the `DepartmentID` column,\n",
    "  which is common to both tables.\n",
    "- The result set will include the `Name` column from the `Students` table and the `DepartmentName`\n",
    "column from the `Departments` table, showing the name of each student along with their corresponding department name.\n",
    "\n",
    "The result of the query would be something like this:\n",

    "    FROM Scores\n",
    ") AS RankedScores\n",
    "WHERE RowNum = 4;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "- The inner query (`SELECT Score, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY Score DESC) AS RowNum FROM Scores`) retrieves\n",
    "the `Score` column along with the row number (`RowNum`) assigned to each score based on their descending order\n",
    "(`ORDER BY Score DESC`).\n",
    "- The outer query selects the `Score` where the `RowNum` is equal to 4, indicating the 4th highest value in the \n",

    "The result of the query will be:\n",
