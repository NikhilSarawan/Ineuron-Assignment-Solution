    "##1. In what modes should the PdfFileReader() and PdfFileWriter() File objects will be opened?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-.When using the PyPDF2 library in Python, the PdfFileReader() and PdfFileWriter() classes are used to read and write PDF,\n",
    "    files, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "    For PdfFileReader(), you should open the PDF file object in \"rb\" (read binary) mode, since a PDF file is a binary file,\n",
    "    format. Here is an example:\n",
    "        \n",
    "    pdf_file = open('example.pdf', 'rb')\n",
    "    pdf_reader = PyPDF2.PdfFileReader(pdf_file)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    For PdfFileWriter(), you should open the PDF file object in \"wb\" (write binary) mode. Here's an example:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    pdf_file = open('output.pdf', 'wb')\n",
    "    pdf_writer = PyPDF2.PdfFileWriter()\n",
    "    \n",
    "    It's important to note that you should always close the file objects using the close() method when you're done with them. \n",
    "    Here's an example:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    pdf_file.close()\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##2. From a PdfFileReader object, how do you get a Page object for page 5?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-.To get a Page object for page 5 from a PdfFileReader object in PyPDF2, you can use the getPage() method and pass the index,\n",
    "    of the page you want (remember that page indexing starts at 0, not 1). Here is an example code snippet:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    import PyPDF2\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Open the PDF file in read-binary mode\n",
    "    pdf_file = open('example.pdf', 'rb')\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Create a PdfFileReader object from the PDF file\n",
    "    pdf_reader = PyPDF2.PdfFileReader(pdf_file)\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Get a Page object for page 5 (index 4)\n",
    "    page_5 = pdf_reader.getPage(4)\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Close the PDF file\n",
    "    pdf_file.close()\n",
    "    \n",
    "    In this example, the getPage() method is called with an argument of 4, since page indexing starts at 0.\n",
    "    The page_5 variable will contain a Page object for page 5 of the PDF.\n",
    "\n",
    "    I hope that helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##3. What PdfFileReader variable stores the number of pages in the PDF document?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-.In PyPDF2, the number of pages in a PDF document can be obtained from the numPages attribute of a PdfFileReader object.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Here's an example code snippet:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    import PyPDF2\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Open the PDF file in read-binary mode\n",
    "    pdf_file = open('example.pdf', 'rb')\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Create a PdfFileReader object from the PDF file\n",
    "    pdf_reader = PyPDF2.PdfFileReader(pdf_file)\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Get the number of pages in the PDF document\n",
    "    num_pages = pdf_reader.numPages\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Close the PDF file\n",
    "    pdf_file.close()\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Print the number of pages\n",
    "    print(f'The PDF document has {num_pages} pages.')\n",
    "    \n",
    "    In this example, numPages is an attribute of the pdf_reader object which stores the number of pages in the PDF document. \n",
    "    The num_pages variable is assigned this value and can be used elsewhere in your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "    I hope that helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "##4. If a PdfFileReader object’s PDF is encrypted with the password swordfish, what must you do before you can obtain,\n",
    "    # Page objects from it?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-.If a PDF file is encrypted with a password, you must provide the password to PyPDF2 before you can obtain Page,\n",
    "    objects from it using the PdfFileReader class.\n",
    "\n",
    "    You can do this by calling the decrypt(password) method on the PdfFileReader object and passing the password as a string.\n",
    "    Here is an example code snippet\n",
    "    \n",
    "    import PyPDF2\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Open the encrypted PDF file in read-binary mode\n",
    "    pdf_file = open('example_encrypted.pdf', 'rb')\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Create a PdfFileReader object from the PDF file\n",
    "    pdf_reader = PyPDF2.PdfFileReader(pdf_file)\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Decrypt the PDF file with the password 'swordfish'\n",
    "    pdf_reader.decrypt('swordfish')\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Get a Page object for page 5 (index 4)\n",
    "    page_5 = pdf_reader.getPage(4)\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Close the PDF file\n",
    "    pdf_file.close()\n",
    "    \n",
    "    In this example, the decrypt() method is called on the pdf_reader object with the password 'swordfish' as an argument.\n",
    "    This decrypts the PDF file and allows you to obtain Page objects from it using the getPage() method.\n",
    "\n",
    "    It is important to note that if the PDF file is encrypted with a different password, you must provide the correct,\n",
    "    password or you will receive a PyPDF2.utils.PdfReadError error.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##5. What methods do you use to rotate a page?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-.To rotate a page in a PDF file using PyPDF2 in Python, you can use the rotateClockwise() or rotateCounterClockwise(),\n",
    "    method of a PageObject.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Here is an example code snippet that rotates the first page of a PDF file 90 degrees clockwise and saves the result ,\n",
    "    to a new PDF file:\n",
    "        \n",
    "    import PyPDF2\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Open the PDF file in read-binary mode\n",
    "    pdf_file = open('example.pdf', 'rb')\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Create a PdfFileReader object from the PDF file\n",
    "    pdf_reader = PyPDF2.PdfFileReader(pdf_file)\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Get the first page of the PDF file\n",
    "    page = pdf_reader.getPage(0)\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Rotate the page 90 degrees clockwise\n",
    "    page.rotateClockwise(90)\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Create a PdfFileWriter object\n",
    "    pdf_writer = PyPDF2.PdfFileWriter()\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Add the rotated page to the PdfFileWriter object\n",
    "    pdf_writer.addPage(page)\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Save the rotated page to a new PDF file\n",
    "    output_file = open('rotated.pdf', 'wb')\n",
    "    pdf_writer.write(output_file)\n",
    "    output_file.close()\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Close the PDF file\n",
    "    pdf_file.close()\n",
    "    \n",
    "    In this example, the rotateClockwise() method is called on the page object with an argument of 90 degrees to rotate ,\n",
    "    the page 90 degrees clockwise. You can also use the rotateCounterClockwise() method to rotate the page counterclockwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "    After rotating the page, the rotated page is added to a new PdfFileWriter object using the addPage() method. Finally, \n",
    "    the write() method is called on the PdfFileWriter object to save the rotated page to a new PDF file.\n",
    "\n",
    "    I hope that helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##6. What is the difference between a Run object and a Paragraph object?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-.In Microsoft Word, a Paragraph object represents a single paragraph of text, while a Run object represents a contiguous,\n",
    "    run of text with the same character formatting.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Here is an example to illustrate the difference:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    This is the first paragraph. It contains a single run of text.\n",
    "\n",
    "    This is the second paragraph. It contains two runs of text: one in bold, and one in italic.\n",
    "        \n",
    "    In this example, the first paragraph contains a single run of text with no formatting applied.\n",
    "    The second paragraph contains two runs of text with different formatting applied to each run.\n",
    "\n",
    "    In Microsoft Word, you can access and manipulate the properties of Paragraph and Run objects using the Word Object Model.\n",
    "    For example, you can change the font size or apply bold formatting to a Run object, or you can set the alignment ,\n",
    "    indentation of a Paragraph object.\n",
    "\n",
    "    To summarize, a Paragraph object represents a block of text with a common formatting, while a Run object represents.\n",
    "    a contiguous run of text with the same formatting within a Paragraph.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##7. How do you obtain a list of Paragraph objects for a Document object that’s stored in a variable named doc?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-.To obtain a list of Paragraph objects for a Document object stored in a variable named doc in Python,\n",
    "    you can use the paragraphs property of the Document object. The paragraphs property returns a list of Paragraph objects,\n",
    "    in the order they appear in the document.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Here's an example code snippet that demonstrates how to obtain a list of Paragraph objects for a Document object:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    import docx\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Open the Word document\n",
    "    doc = docx.Document('example.docx')\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Get a list of Paragraph objects in the document\n",
    "    paragraphs = doc.paragraphs\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Print the text of each Paragraph object\n",
    "    for paragraph in paragraphs:\n",
    "    print(paragraph.text)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    In this example, the Document object is created by passing the name of the Word document to the docx.Document() constructor.\n",
    "    The paragraphs property is then used to obtain a list of Paragraph objects, which is stored in the paragraphs variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Finally, a for loop is used to iterate through the Paragraph objects in the list and print the text of each Paragraph,\n",
    "    object using the text property.\n",
    "\n",
    "    You can also access individual Paragraph objects by index, like this: paragraph = doc.paragraphs[index], where index is the,\n",
    "    zero-based index of the Paragraph object you want to access.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##8. What type of object has bold, underline, italic, strike, and outline variables?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-.In Python's docx library, the Font object has bold, underline, italic, strike, and outline variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The Font object represents the character formatting of a run of text within a paragraph in a Microsoft Word document\n",
    "    The bold, underline, italic, strike, and outline variables are Boolean properties of the Font object that determine,\n",
    "    whether the run of text is formatted as bold, underlined, italicized, struck-through, or outlined, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Here's an example code snippet that demonstrates how to access the Font object of a run of text and modify its ,\n",
    "    formatting properties:\n",
    "        \n",
    "    import docx\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Open the Word document\n",
    "    doc = docx.Document('example.docx')\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Get the first paragraph and the second run of text in it\n",
    "    paragraph = doc.paragraphs[0]\n",
    "    run = paragraph.runs[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Set the bold and italic properties of the Font object for the run of text\n",
    "    font = run.font\n",
    "    font.bold = True\n",
    "    font.italic = True\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Save the modified document to a new file\n",
    "    doc.save('modified.docx')\n",
    "    \n",
    "    In this example, the Document object is created by passing the name of the Word document to the docx.Document() constructor.\n",
    "    The paragraphs and runs properties are then used to obtain the first paragraph and the second run of text in it,\n",
    "    which are stored in the paragraph and run variables, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The Font object of the run of text is accessed using the font property, and its bold and italic properties are set to True ,\n",
    "    to make the run of text bold and italic. Finally, the save() method is called on the Document object to save the modified ,\n",
    "    document to a new file.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##9. What is the difference between False, True, and None for the bold variable?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-.In Python's docx library, the bold property of the Font object can be set to True, False, or None.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Setting bold to True makes the text bold.\n",
    "    Setting bold to False makes the text not bold.\n",
    "    Setting bold to None preserves the existing boldness of the text.\n",
    "    When bold is set to None, the Font object inherits the boldness of the style applied to the run of text. \n",
    "    If the style has boldness set, the text will be bold; otherwise, it will not be bold.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Here's an example code snippet that demonstrates how to set the bold property of the Font object to True, False, and None:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    import docx\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Open the Word document\n",
    "    doc = docx.Document('example.docx')\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Get the first paragraph and the first run of text in it\n",
    "    paragraph = doc.paragraphs[0]\n",
    "    run = paragraph.runs[0]\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Set the bold property of the Font object for the run of text to True, False, and None\n",
    "    font = run.font\n",
    "    font.bold = True\n",
    "    font.bold = False\n",
    "    font.bold = None\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Save the modified document to a new file\n",
    "    doc.save('modified.docx')\n",
    "    \n",
    "    In this example, the Document object is created by passing the name of the Word document to the docx.Document() constructor.\n",
    "    The paragraphs and runs properties are then used to obtain the first paragraph and the first run of text in it,\n",
    "    which are stored in the paragraph and run variables, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The Font object of the run of text is accessed using the font property, and its bold property is set to True, False, \n",
    "    and None to make the text bold, not bold, and preserve its existing boldness, respectively. Finally, the save() method ,\n",
    "    is called on the Document object to save the modified document to a new file.\n",
    "\n",
    "    I hope that clarifies the difference between False, True, and None for the bold variable in the Font object.\n",
    "\n",
    "##10. How do you create a Document object for a new Word document?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-.To create a new Word document in Python using the docx library, you can start by creating a Document object, \n",
    "    which represents a new blank Word document. Here's an example code snippet that demonstrates how to create a ,\n",
    "    new Word document using the docx library\n",
    "    \n",
    "    import docx\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Create a new Document object\n",
    "    doc = docx.Document()\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Add some text to the document\n",
    "    doc.add_paragraph('Hello, world!')\n",
    "    doc.add_heading('My Heading', level=1)\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Save the document to a file\n",
    "    doc.save('my_document.docx')\n",
    "    \n",
    "    In this example, the Document object is created by calling the docx.Document() constructor with no arguments,\n",
    "    which creates a new, empty Word document. You can then add content to the document using the various methods ,\n",
    "    provided by the Document object, such as add_paragraph() to add a new paragraph of text and add_heading() to add,\n",
    "    a heading. Finally, you can save the document to a file using the save() method.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Once you have created the Document object, you can add various types of content to it, such as paragraphs,\n",
    "    headings, tables, images, and more. You can also format the content using various properties of the Paragraph, Run,\n",
    "    Table, and other objects provided by the docx library.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##11. How do you add a paragraph with the text 'Hello, there!' to a Document object stored in a variable named doc?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-.You can add a new paragraph with the text \"Hello, there!\" to a Document object stored in a variable named doc using ,\n",
    "    the add_paragraph() method provided by the docx library.Here's an example code snippet that demonstrates how to do this:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    import docx\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Open an existing Word document\n",
    "    doc = docx.Document('my_document.docx')\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Add a new paragraph with the text \"Hello, there!\"\n",
    "    doc.add_paragraph('Hello, there!')\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Save the modified document to a file\n",
    "    doc.save('my_modified_document.docx')\n",
    "    \n",
    "    In this example, the Document object is created by opening an existing Word document named \"my_document.docx\" ,\n",
    "    using the docx.Document() constructor. You can then add a new paragraph with the text \"Hello, there!\" to the ,\n",
    "    document using the add_paragraph() method provided by the Document object. Finally, you can save the modified ,\n",
    "    document to a new file using the save() method.\n",
    "\n",
    "    If you want to add the paragraph at a specific location in the document, you can use the insert_paragraph_before() or,\n",
    "    insert_paragraph_after() method instead of add_paragraph(). These methods allow you to insert the new paragraph before,\n",
    "    or after an existing paragraph in the document, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##12. What integers represent the levels of headings available in Word documents?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-.In Word documents, headings are typically organized into a hierarchy of levels, with level 1 headings being ,\n",
    "    most important and level 9 headings being the least important. The python-docx library, which is commonly used to ,\n",
    "    work with Word documents in Python, defines the following integer constants to represent the various heading levels:\n",
    "\n",
    "    docx.enum.style.WD_STYLE_TYPE.PARAGRAPH: Represents a normal paragraph with no heading level.\n",
    "    docx.enum.style.WD_STYLE_TYPE.HEADER: Represents a header paragraph, which is not part of the heading hierarchy.\n",
    "    docx.enum.style.WD_STYLE_TYPE.HEADING_1: Represents a level 1 heading.\n",
    "    docx.enum.style.WD_STYLE_TYPE.HEADING_2: Represents a level 2 heading.\n",
    "    docx.enum.style.WD_STYLE_TYPE.HEADING_3: Represents a level 3 heading.\n",
    "    docx.enum.style.WD_STYLE_TYPE.HEADING_4: Represents a level 4 heading.\n",
    "    docx.enum.style.WD_STYLE_TYPE.HEADING_5: Represents a level 5 heading.\n",
    "    docx.enum.style.WD_STYLE_TYPE.HEADING_6: Represents a level 6 heading.\n",
    "    docx.enum.style.WD_STYLE_TYPE.HEADING_7: Represents a level 7 heading.\n",
    "    docx.enum.style.WD_STYLE_TYPE.HEADING_8: Represents a level 8 heading.\n",
    "    docx.enum.style.WD_STYLE_TYPE.HEADING_9: Represents a level 9 heading.\n",
    "    To use these constants in your code, you can import them from the docx.enum.style module and use them with,\n",
    "    the add_heading() method provided by the Document object. For example, to add a level 3 heading with the text,\n",
    "    \"My Heading\" to a Document object stored in a variable named doc, you can use the following code:\n",
    "        \n",
    "    import docx.enum.style as style\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Add a level 3 heading to the document\n",
    "    doc.add_heading('My Heading', level=style.WD_STYLE_TYPE.HEADING_3)\n"
