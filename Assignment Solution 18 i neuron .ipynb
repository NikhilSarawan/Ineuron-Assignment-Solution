    "##1. Create a zoo.py file first. Define the hours() function, which prints the string 'Open 9-5 daily'. Then,\n",
    "     #use the interactive interpreter to import the zoo module and call its hours() function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-.To create a zoo.py file, open a text editor and type the following code:\n",
    "    def hours():\n",
    "    print('Open 9-5 daily')\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Save the file as zoo.py in a directory of your choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "    To use the interactive interpreter, open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where zoo.py is saved,\n",
    "    and type python to start the Python interpreter. Then, type the following commands:\n",
    "        \n",
    "    import zoo\n",
    "    zoo.hours()\n",
    "    \n",
    "    This should output the string \"Open 9-5 daily\" to the console.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##2. In the interactive interpreter, import the zoo module as menagerie and call its hours() function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-.As the code was already executed in the previous question, we can simply run the following code in the interactive,\n",
    "    interpreter to import the zoo module as menagerie and call its hours() function:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    import zoo as menagerie\n",
    "    menagerie.hours()\n",
    "\n",
    "    This should print the output: Open 9-5 daily.\n",
    "\n",
    "##3. Using the interpreter, explicitly import and call the hours() function from zoo.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-.from zoo import hours\n",
    "\n",
    "    hours()\n",
    "    \n",
    "    This will import the hours() function from the zoo module and call it, printing the string 'Open 9-5 daily'.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##4. Import the hours() function as info and call it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-.Here is how you can import the hours() function as info and call it:\n",
    "\n",
    "    from zoo import hours as info\n",
    "\n",
    "    info()\n",
    "\n",
    "    This will call the hours() function from the zoo module but it will be referred to as info in the current namespace.\n",

    "##5. Create a plain dictionary with the key-value pairs 'a': 1, 'b': 2, and 'c': 3, and print it out.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-.Here is how you can create a plain dictionary with the given key-value pairs and print it out:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # create the dictionary\n",
    "    my_dict = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}\n",

    "##6.Make an OrderedDict called fancy from the same pairs listed in 5 and print it. Did it print in the same order as plain?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-.No, it printed in the same order as the order in which the keys were added. OrderedDict remembers the order in which items were added, whereas a regular dictionary does not. \n",
    "    Here is an example code snippet to create an OrderedDict and print it:\n",
    "        \n",
    "    from collections import OrderedDict\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Create an OrderedDict\n",
    "    fancy = OrderedDict([('a', 1), ('b', 2), ('c', 3)])\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Print the OrderedDict\n",
    "    print(fancy)\n",
    "\n",
    "    This will output:\n",
    "\n",
    "    OrderedDict([('a', 1), ('b', 2), ('c', 3)])\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##7. Make a default dictionary called dict_of_lists and pass it the argument list. Make the list dict_of_lists['a'] and,\n",
    "    #append the value 'something for a' to it in one assignment. Print dict_of_lists['a'].\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-.Here is the code to make a default dictionary called dict_of_lists, append a value to the list for key 'a', \n",
    "    then print the list for key 'a':\n",
    "        \n",
