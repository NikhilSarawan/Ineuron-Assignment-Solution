    "##1. How do you distinguish between shutil.copy() and shutil.copytree()?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-.shutil.copy() and shutil.copytree() are both functions in Python's shutil module used to copy files and directories. \n",
    "    The main difference between these two functions is that shutil.copy() is used to copy a single file from one location,\n",
    "    to another while shutil.copytree() is used to copy an entire directory and all its contents recursively.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Here are some examples to illustrate the differences:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Using shutil.copy()\n",
    "\n",
    "    To copy a single file using shutil.copy(), you can do the following:\n",
    "    import shutil\n",
    "\n",
    "    # specify the source and destination paths for the file to be copied\n",
    "    src_path = '/path/to/source/file.txt'\n",
    "    dst_path = '/path/to/destination/'\n",
    "\n",
    "    # use shutil.copy() to copy the file\n",
    "    shutil.copy(src_path, dst_path)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    This will copy the file file.txt from the source directory to the destination directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Using shutil.copytree()\n",
    "    \n",
    "    To copy an entire directory and all its contents recursively using shutil.copytree(), you can do the following:\n",
    "    import shutil\n",
    "\n",
    "    # specify the source and destination paths for the directory to be copied\n",
    "    src_path = '/path/to/source/directory/'\n",
    "    dst_path = '/path/to/destination/'\n",
    "\n",
    "    # use shutil.copytree() to copy the entire directory\n",
    "    shutil.copytree(src_path, dst_path)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    This will copy the entire source directory and all its contents to the destination directory.\n",
    "    Note that if the destination directory already exists, shutil.copytree() will raise a FileExistsError.\n",
    "\n",
    "    In summary, shutil.copy() is used to copy a single file, while shutil.copytree() is used to copy an entire directory,\n",
    "    and all its contents recursively.\n",
    "  \n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "##2. What function is used to rename files??\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-.In Python, the os.rename() function is used to rename files or directories. This function takes two arguments - \n",
    "    the current name of the file or directory, and the new name that you want to give it.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Here's an example of how to use os.rename() to rename a file:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    import os\n",
    "\n",
    "    # specify the current and new file names\n",
    "    current_name = 'old_file_name.txt'\n",
    "    new_name = 'new_file_name.txt'\n",
    "\n",
    "    # use os.rename() to rename the file\n",
    "    os.rename(current_name, new_name)\n",
    "\n",
    "    This will rename the file old_file_name.txt to new_file_name.txt. Note that if the file with the new name,\n",
    "    already exists in the directory, os.rename() will replace it with the renamed file.\n",
    "\n",
    "    You can also use os.rename() to move a file to a different directory by specifying the full path of the new,\n",
    "    location in the new name argument. For example:\n",
    "        \n",
    "    import os\n",
    "\n",
    "    # specify the current file path and the new directory path\n",
    "    current_path = '/path/to/current/file.txt'\n",
    "    new_path = '/path/to/new/directory/new_file_name.txt'\n",
    "\n",
    "    # use os.rename() to move the file to the new directory and give it a new name\n",
    "    os.rename(current_path, new_path)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    This will move the file file.txt from its current location to the directory /path/to/new/directory and rename,\n",
    "    it as new_file_name.txt.\n",
    "\n",
    "    In summary, the os.rename() function is used to rename files or directories in Python.\n",
    "  \n",
    "        \n",
    "##3. What is the difference between the delete functions in the send2trash and shutil modules?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-.The send2trash and shutil modules are both used for deleting files and directories in Python,\n",
    "    but they have some differences in their functionalities and behaviors.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The send2trash module provides a cross-platform implementation of sending files to the operating system is,\n",
    "    trash or recycle bin instead of permanently deleting them. This allows the user to recover deleted files if needed, \n",
    "    similar to how the \"move to trash\" function works in most graphical user interfaces. The send2trash module provides,\n",
    "    a single function send2trash.send2trash() that takes a file or directory path as an argument and sends it to the trash ,\n",
    "    or recycle bin, depending on the operating system.\n",
    "\n",
    "    On the other hand, the shutil module provides more low-level file and directory operations, including copying, moving, \n",
    "    and deleting files and directories. The shutil module provides several functions for deleting files and directories,\n",
    "    including shutil.rmtree() for deleting directories and their contents recursively, and os.remove() for deleting individual,\n",
    "    files. These functions delete files and directories permanently and do not send them to the operating system is trash or,\n",
    "    recycle bin.\n",
    "\n",
    "    In summary, the main difference between the delete functions in send2trash and shutil is that send2trash sends files to ,\n",
    "    the operating system is trash or recycle bin, while shutil deletes files and directories permanently.\n",

    "##4.ZipFile objects have a close() method just like File objects’ close() method. What ZipFile method is equivalent,\n",
    "    #,to File objects’ open() method?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-.ZipFile objects are used to read and manipulate ZIP archives in Python. Similar to File objects,\n",
    "    ZipFile objects have a close() method that should be called when you are finished working with the archive,\n",
    "    to free up any resources used by the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The equivalent ZipFile method to File objects' open() method is ZipFile() itself.\n",
    "    You can create a ZipFile object and open a ZIP archive for reading or writing by passing the archive is\n",
    "    filename as a string argument to the ZipFile() constructor. For example, to open a ZIP archive named \"example.zip\" \n",
    "    for reading, you can use the following code:\n",
    "        \n",
    "    import zipfile\n",
    "\n",
    "    with zipfile.ZipFile('example.zip', 'r') as myzip:\n",
    "    # work with the contents of the archive\n",
    "    In this example, ZipFile() is used to open the \"example.zip\" archive for reading ('r'). \n",
    "    The resulting ZipFile object is assigned to the variable myzip, and the with statement is used to ensure that the close(),\n",
    "    method is automatically called when the block of code is finished executing.\n",

    "##5. Create a programme that searches a folder tree for files with a certain file extension (such as .pdf or .jpg).\n",
    "    ##,Copy these files from whatever location they are in to a new folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-.Here is an example Python program that searches,a folder tree for files with a certain file extension and copies,\n",
    "    them to a new folder:\n",
    "        \n",
    "    import os\n",
    "    import shutil\n",
    "\n",
    "    # set the source folder and file extension to search for\n",
    "    src_folder = '/path/to/source/folder'\n",
    "    file_ext = '.pdf'\n",
    "\n",
    "    # set the destination folder to copy the files to\n",
    "    dest_folder = '/path/to/destination/folder'\n",
    "\n",
    "    # create the destination folder if it doesn't exist\n",
    "    if not os.path.exists(dest_folder):\n",
    "    os.makedirs(dest_folder)\n",
    "\n",
    "    # walk through the source folder and its subfolders\n",
    "    for foldername, subfolders, filenames in os.walk(src_folder):\n",
    "    # loop through the files in the current folder\n",
    "    for filename in filenames:\n",
    "    # check if the file has the desired extension\n",
    "    if filename.endswith(file_ext):\n",
    "    # get the full path of the file and the destination path\n",
    "    src_path = os.path.join(foldername, filename)\n",
    "    dest_path = os.path.join(dest_folder, filename)\n",
    "    # copy the file to the destination folder\n",
    "    shutil.copy(src_path, dest_path)\n",
    "    print(f\"Copied {src_path} to {dest_path}\")\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "    Here's how the program works:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1.Set the source folder and file extension to search for (src_folder and file_ext).\n",
    "    2.Set the destination folder to copy the files to (dest_folder).\n",
    "    3.Check if the destination folder exists, and create it if it doesn't (os.makedirs()).\n",
    "    4.Use os.walk() to traverse the source folder and its subfolders.\n",
    "    5.Loop through the files in each folder and check if they have the desired file extension (filename.endswith()).\n",
    "    6.Get the full path of the file (os.path.join()) and the destination path in the destination folder.\n",
    "    7.Use shutil.copy() to copy the file to the destination folder.\n",
    "    8.Print a message indicating the source and destination paths of each file that is copied.\n",
    "    You can modify the program by changing the src_folder, file_ext, and dest_folder variables to match,\n",
    "    your specific use case."
