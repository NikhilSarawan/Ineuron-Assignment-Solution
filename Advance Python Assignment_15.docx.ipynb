    "1. What are the new features added in Python 3.8 version?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-\n",
    "\n",
    "Python 3.8, released in October 2019, introduced several new features and optimizations.\n",
    "Some of the notable features added in Python 3.8 include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Assignment Expressions (The Walrus Operator `:=`):**\n",
    "   - Allows assignment inside expressions using the `:=` operator. It assigns the value of the ,\n",
    "    expression to the variable and then returns the value.\n",
    "   - Example:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     while (n := input(\"Enter a number: \")) != \"0\":\n",
    "         print(\"You entered:\", n)\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Positional-only Parameters:**\n",
    "   - Functions can now specify parameters as positional-only by using the `/` syntax in function definitions.\n",
    "    Parameters before `/` must be specified as positional arguments.\n",
    "   - Example:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     def func(a, b, /, c, d):\n",
    "         print(a, b, c, d)\n",
    "\n",
    "     func(1, 2, 3, 4)  # Output: 1 2 3 4\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **f-strings Improvements:**\n",
    "   - Support for the `=` specifier in f-strings to display variable names along with their values.\n",
    "   - Example:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     name = \"Alice\"\n",
    "     print(f\"{name=}\")  # Output: name='Alice'\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Syntax Warning Removals:**\n",
    "   - Removed syntax warnings that were previously emitted for constructs that were never legal syntax but ,\n",
    "   were previously not recognized as errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **New Syntax Features:**\n",
    "   - Support for the `__future__` module in type annotations.\n",
    "   - The `match` statement: Similar to a `switch` statement in other languages, it provides pattern matching,\n",
    "    for structural pattern matching.\n",
    "   - The `:=` operator (walrus operator) can now be used in comprehensions and lambda functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Performance Optimizations:**\n",
    "   - Various performance improvements and optimizations, making Python 3.8 faster than previous versions in many cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **New Syntax and Libraries:**\n",
    "   - The `math.prod()` function, which calculates the product of iterable elements.\n",
    "   - The `math.isqrt()` function, which computes the integer square root of a non-negative integer.\n",
    "   - The `importlib.metadata` module, providing an API for reading metadata from installed distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Typing Annotations Improvements:**\n",
    "   - Improvements and additions to the `typing` module, including `Protocol` for structural typing and `TypedDict`,\n",
    "   for specifying dictionaries with a fixed set of keys and value types.\n",
    "\n",
    "   These are just a few of the new features introduced in Python 3.8. For a complete list of changes and enhancements, \n",
    "    you can refer to the official Python documentation.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "2. What is monkey patching in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-\n",
    "\n",
    "Monkey patching in Python refers to the practice of dynamically modifying or extending the behavior ,\n",
    "of existing modules, classes, or functions at runtime. It allows developers to alter or augment the ,\n",
    "functionality of libraries, frameworks, or third-party code without modifying their original source code. \n",
    "Monkey patching can be a powerful technique, but it should be used cautiously and sparingly, as it can make,\n",
    "code harder to understand and maintain if misused.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an overview of how monkey patching works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Dynamic Modification:** Monkey patching involves making changes to classes, functions, or modules at,\n",
    "    runtime by adding, modifying, or replacing methods, attributes, or functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Use Cases:**\n",
    "   - **Fixing Bugs:** Monkey patching can be used to fix bugs in third-party libraries or frameworks without,\n",
    "    waiting for an official fix.\n",
    "   - **Adding Functionality:** Developers can add new methods or functions to existing classes or modules to ,\n",
    "    extend their functionality.\n",
    "   - **Testing:** Monkey patching can be useful in testing environments to replace real implementations with ,\n",
    "    mock or testing implementations.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   Suppose you have a class `MyClass` with a method `original_method()`:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   class MyClass:\n",
    "       def original_method(self):\n",
    "           return \"Original implementation\"\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   You can monkey patch the class by adding a new method:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   def new_method(self):\n",
    "       return \"Monkey patched implementation\"\n",
    "\n",
    "   MyClass.original_method = new_method\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   Now, when you create an instance of `MyClass` and call `original_method()`, it will execute the monkey patched,\n",
    "    implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   obj = MyClass()\n",
    "   print(obj.original_method())  # Output: \"Monkey patched implementation\"\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Considerations:**\n",
    "   - **Compatibility:** Be mindful of compatibility issues when monkey patching third-party libraries, as updates,\n",
    "    to the library might conflict with your patches.\n",
    "   - **Clarity and Documentation:** Proper documentation and clear comments are essential when using monkey patching,\n",
    "    as it makes the code less intuitive and can be confusing for other developers.\n",
    "   - **Use Sparingly:** Monkey patching should be used sparingly and only when necessary. It's usually better to ,\n",
    "    subclass or use other forms of extension to avoid unexpected side effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "While monkey patching can be a valuable tool, it should be applied with caution and in situations where no better,\n",
    "alternatives exist. Overuse of monkey patching can lead to maintenance challenges and unexpected behavior in the long run.\n",

    "3. What is the difference between a shallow copy and deep copy?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, the concepts of shallow copy and deep copy are related to copying compound objects,\n",
    "(objects that contain other objects, like lists or dictionaries). The difference between them lies in how,\n",
    "they handle nested objects within the compound object.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Shallow Copy:\n",
    "\n",
    "A shallow copy creates a new compound object but does not create copies of nested objects within the original,\n",
    "compound object. Instead, it copies references to the nested objects. In other words, changes made to nested ,\n",
    "objects in a shallow copy will affect both the original and the shallow copy, as they share the same references,\n",
    "to the nested objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can create a shallow copy of a compound object using the `copy()` method or the `copy` module's `copy()` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example of a shallow copy:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import copy\n",
    "\n",
    "original_list = [1, [2, 3], [4, 5]]\n",
    "shallow_copy_list = copy.copy(original_list)\n",
    "\n",
    "print(shallow_copy_list)  # Output: [1, [2, 3], [4, 5]]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Modify the nested list in the shallow copy\n",
    "shallow_copy_list[1][0] = 99\n",
    "\n",
    "print(original_list)  # Output: [1, [99, 3], [4, 5]]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As shown in the example, modifying the nested list within the shallow copy affects the original list as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Deep Copy:\n",
    "\n",
    "A deep copy creates a new compound object and recursively creates copies of all nested objects within the ,\n",
    "original compound object. Deep copy ensures that changes made to nested objects in the copy do not affect the original, \n",
    "as they are separate objects in memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can create a deep copy of a compound object using the `copy` module's `deepcopy()` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example of a deep copy:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import copy\n",
    "\n",
    "original_list = [1, [2, 3], [4, 5]]\n",
    "deep_copy_list = copy.deepcopy(original_list)\n",
    "\n",
    "print(deep_copy_list)  # Output: [1, [2, 3], [4, 5]]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Modify the nested list in the deep copy\n",
    "deep_copy_list[1][0] = 99\n",
    "\n",
    "print(original_list)  # Output: [1, [2, 3], [4, 5]]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the deep copy example, modifying the nested list within the deep copy does not affect the original list.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, a shallow copy creates a new compound object but references the same nested objects, \n",
    "a deep copy creates a new compound object and recursively creates copies of all nested objects, \n",
    "ensuring independence between the original and the copy. The choice between shallow copy and deep,\n",
    "copy depends on whether you want changes to nested objects to affect both the original and the copy ,\n",
    "(shallow copy) or if you want them to be independent (deep copy).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. What is the maximum possible length of an identifier?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, there is no maximum length for an identifier. You can create identifiers of any length, \n",
    "limited only by the available memory of your system. However, it's important to note that excessively long ,\n",
    "identifiers can make your code less readable and harder to maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "While Python allows you to use very long identifiers, it's a good practice to keep your variable, function,\n",
    "and class names reasonably short and descriptive. PEP 8, the official style guide for Python, recommends limiting,\n",
    "all lines to a maximum of 79 characters for better readability. Similarly, descriptive yet concise identifiers,\n",
    "contribute to the readability of your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, there is no fixed maximum length for identifiers in Python, but it's advisable to keep your identifier,\n",
    "names reasonably short and meaningful to enhance the clarity and maintainability of your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. What is generator comprehension?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-\n",
    "\n",
    "Generator comprehension, also known as generator expression, is a concise way to create generators in Python. \n",
    "It has a similar syntax to list comprehensions, but it produces generator objects instead of lists. Generator,\n",
    "comprehensions are memory-efficient because they generate values on-the-fly and do not store the entire sequence in memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the basic syntax of a generator comprehension:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "generator_expression = (expression for item in iterable if condition)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- `expression`: The expression that calculates the values in the generator.\n",
    "- `item`: Variable representing each item in the iterable (e.g., list, tuple, range).\n",
    "- `iterable`: The iterable you want to loop through.\n",
    "- `condition`: (Optional) A condition to filter items. Only items that satisfy this condition will be,\n",
    "    included in the generator.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike list comprehensions, generator comprehensions are enclosed in parentheses `()` instead of square brackets `[]`. \n",
    "When you iterate through the generator, it produces values on demand, saving memory and processing time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 1: List Comprehension vs. Generator Comprehension\n",
    "\n",
    "**List Comprehension:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "list_comp = [x for x in range(1, 6)]\n",
    "print(list_comp)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Generator Comprehension:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "generator_comp = (x for x in range(1, 6))\n",
    "print(generator_comp)  # Output: <generator object <genexpr> at 0x...>\n",
    "\n",
    "# To get the values from the generator, you can iterate through it\n",
    "for num in generator_comp:\n",
    "    print(num)  # Output: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 (printed one at a time)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 2: Generator Comprehension with Condition\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Generator comprehension to generate squares of numbers less than 5\n",
    "squares = (x**2 for x in range(10) if x < 5)\n",
    "\n",
    "# To get the values, you can use a loop or convert the generator to a list\n",
    "print(list(squares))  # Output: [0, 1, 4, 9, 16]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the generator comprehension generates squares of numbers from 0 to 4 (less than 5).\n",
    "\n",
    "Generator comprehensions are particularly useful when dealing with large datasets or when you need to iterate,\n",
    "through a sequence of values without loading the entire sequence into memory.\n"
