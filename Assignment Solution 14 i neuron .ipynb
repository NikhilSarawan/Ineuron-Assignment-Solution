    "##1. What does RGBA stand for?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-.RGBA stands for Red Green Blue Alpha. It is a color model used in digital graphics to represent colors with red, \n",
    "    green, and blue light, and also includes an alpha channel for representing transparency. The alpha channel specifies,\n",
    "    the level of opacity or transparency of the color. The RGBA color model is commonly used in web design, digital imaging, \n",
    "    and computer graphics.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "##2. From the Pillow module, how do you get the RGBA value of any images?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-.To get the RGBA (Red Green Blue Alpha) value of any image using the Pillow module in Python, you can use the getpixel(),\n",
    "    method of the Image object. Here's an example:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "    from PIL import Image\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Open the image\n",
    "    img = Image.open(\"image.png\")\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Get the pixel value at position (x,y)\n",
    "    x = 0\n",
    "    y = 0\n",
    "    rgba = img.getpixel((x, y))\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Print the RGBA value\n",
    "    print(\"RGBA value at position ({},{}): {}\".format(x, y, rgba))\n",
    "    \n",
    "    In this example, we first open the image using the Image.open() method. Then, we use the getpixel(),\n",
    "    method to get the RGBA value at a particular pixel position, which we specify using a tuple (x, y). Finally, \n",
    "    we print out the RGBA value using the print() function.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "##3. What is a box tuple, and how does it work?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-.In Pillow and other image processing libraries, a box tuple is a tuple of four integers that defines a ,\n",
    "    rectangular region in an image. The four integers represent the left, upper, right, and lower coordinates of ,\n",
    "    the rectangle, respectively. The box tuple is usually denoted as (left, upper, right, lower) or (x1, y1, x2, y2),\n",
    "    where left or x1 is the x-coordinate of the left edge of the rectangle, upper or y1 is the y-coordinate of the upper,\n",
    "    edge of the rectangle, right or x2 is the x-coordinate of the right edge of the rectangle, and lower or y2 is the ,\n",
    "    y-coordinate of the lower edge of the rectangle.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The box tuple is often used as an argument in various image processing methods to specify a region of interest,\n",
    "    (ROI) within the image. For example, the crop() method of the Image object in Pillow takes a box tuple as an ,\n",
    "    argument to specify the rectangular region to be cropped from the image.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Here's an example that demonstrates how the box tuple works in Pillow\n",
    "    \n",
    "    from PIL import Image\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Open the image\n",
    "    img = Image.open(\"image.png\")\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Define a box tuple (left, upper, right, lower)\n",
    "    box = (100, 100, 200, 200)\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Crop the image using the box tuple\n",
    "    cropped_img = img.crop(box)\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Display the cropped image\n",
    "    cropped_img.show()\n",
    "    \n",
    "    In this example, we define a box tuple (100, 100, 200, 200) that specifies a rectangular region starting at coordinates \n",
    "    (100, 100) and ending at coordinates (200, 200). We then use the crop() method to crop the image using the box tuple, \n",
    "    and display the resulting cropped image using the show() method.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##4. Use your image and load in notebook then, How can you find out the width and height of an Image object?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-.To find out the width and height of an image loaded as an Image object in a Jupyter Notebook using the Pillow library,\n",
    "    we can use the size attribute of the Image object. Here's an example:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    from PIL import Image\n",
    "    import requests\n",
    "    from io import BytesIO\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Load the image from a URL\n",
    "    url = \"https://example.com/image.jpg\"\n",
    "    response = requests.get(url)\n",
    "    img = Image.open(BytesIO(response.content))\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Get the size of the image\n",
    "    width, height = img.size\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Print the width and height\n",
    "    print(\"Width:\", width)\n",
    "    print(\"Height:\", height)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    In this example, we first load the image from a URL using the requests library and the BytesIO class from the io module. \n",
    "    We then open the image using the Image.open() method of the Pillow library. Finally, we get the size of the image using ,\n",
    "    the size attribute of the Image object, and print the width and height using the print() function.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Note that you can also load the image from a file on your local machine using the Image.open() method and passing the ,\n",
    "    path as an argument. In that case, you can skip the requests and BytesIO parts and directly get the size of the image using,\n",
    "    the size attribute.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##5. What method would you call to get Image object for a 100×100 image, excluding the lower-left quarter of it?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-.To get an Image object for a 100x100 image, excluding the lower-left quarter of it, you can use the crop() method of the,\n",
    "    Image object. Here's an example:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    from PIL import Image\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Open the original image\n",
    "    img = Image.open(\"original_image.png\")\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Define the box tuple for the upper-right quadrant\n",
    "    box = (50, 0, 100, 50)\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Crop the image to the specified box\n",
    "    cropped_img = img.crop(box)\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Display the cropped image\n",
    "    cropped_img.show()\n",
    "    \n",
    "    In this example, we first open the original image using the Image.open() method. We then define a box tuple (50, 0, 100, 50),\n",
    "    that specifies the rectangular region starting at coordinates (50, 0) and ending at coordinates (100, 50), which corresponds,\n",
    "    to the upper-right quadrant of the image. We then use the crop() method to crop the image to the specified box, and assign,\n",
    "    the resulting Image object to the variable cropped_img. Finally, we display the cropped image using the show() method.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Note that the first two integers in the box tuple represent the (x, y) coordinates of the upper-left corner of the box, \n",
    "    and the last two integers represent the (x, y) coordinates of the lower-right corner of the box.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##6. After making changes to an Image object, how could you save it as an image file?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-.After making changes to an Image object using Pillow, you can save it as an image file using the save() method of the,\n",
    "    Image object. Here's an example:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    from PIL import Image\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Open the original image\n",
    "    img = Image.open(\"original_image.png\")\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Do some processing to the image\n",
    "    # ...\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Save the modified image as a new file\n",
    "    img.save(\"modified_image.png\")\n",
    "    \n",
    "    In this example, we first open the original image using the Image.open() method and assign the resulting,\n",
    "    Image object to the variable img. We then perform some processing on the image (e.g., cropping, resizing, applying filters\n",
    "    etc.). Finally, we save the modified image to a file using the save() method and passing the file name as an argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "    By default, the save() method saves the image in the same format as the original image. However, you can also specify,\n",
    "    the format explicitly by passing the file extension as the second argument to the save() method. For example,\n",
    "    to save the modified image as a JPEG file, you can use the following code:\n",
    "        \n",
    "    img.save(\"modified_image.jpg\", \"JPEG\")\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "    This will save the modified image as a JPEG file with the file name modified_image.jpg.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##7. What module contains Pillow’s shape-drawing code?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-.Pillow is shape-drawing code is contained in the ImageDraw module. This module provides a Draw class,\n",
    "    that can be used to create a new ImageDraw object, which in turn provides various methods for drawing shapes\n",
    "    (e.g., lines, rectangles, circles, polygons, etc.) on an Image object.\n",
    "\n",
    "    To use the shape-drawing code in Pillow, you need to import the ImageDraw module and create a new ImageDraw object,\n",
    "    for the Image object you want to draw on. Here's an example:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    from PIL import Image, ImageDraw\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Open the original image\n",
    "    img = Image.open(\"original_image.png\")\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Create a new ImageDraw object\n",
    "    draw = ImageDraw.Draw(img)\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Draw a line from (0, 0) to (100, 100) with red color and thickness of 2 pixels\n",
    "    draw.line((0, 0, 100, 100), fill=\"red\", width=2)\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Draw a rectangle with blue outline and no fill\n",
    "    draw.rectangle((50, 50, 150, 100), outline=\"blue\")\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Save the modified image to a file\n",
    "    img.save(\"modified_image.png\")\n",
    "    \n",
    "    In this example, we first open the original image using the Image.open() method and assign the resulting Image ,\n",
    "    object to the variable img. We then create a new ImageDraw object by calling the ImageDraw.Draw() method with,\n",
    "    the Image object as an argument, and assign the resulting object to the variable draw. We can then use the various ,\n",
    "    drawing methods provided by the ImageDraw object to draw shapes on the image. Finally, we save the modified image to,\n",
    "    a file using the save() method as shown in the previous answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##8. Image objects do not have drawing methods. What kind of object does? How do you get this kind of object?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-.You are correct that Image objects themselves do not have drawing methods. Instead, drawing methods are provided by,\n",
    "    the ImageDraw module in Pillow, specifically by the Draw class.\n",
    "\n",
    "    To use the drawing methods provided by ImageDraw, you need to create a Draw object for the Image you want to draw on.\n",
    "    Here's an example:\n",
    "    from PIL import Image, ImageDraw\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Open the original image\n",
    "    img = Image.open(\"original_image.png\")\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Create a Draw object for the image\n",
    "    draw = ImageDraw.Draw(img)\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Draw a line on the image\n",
    "    draw.line((0, 0, 100, 100), fill=\"red\", width=2)\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Save the modified image to a file\n",
    "    img.save(\"modified_image.png\")\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "    In this example, we first open the original image using the Image.open() method and assign the resulting ,\n",
    "    Image object to the variable img. We then create a Draw object for the image by calling the ImageDraw.Draw(),\n",
    "    method with the Image object as an argument, and assign the resulting object to the variable draw. We can then,\n",
    "    use the drawing methods provided by the Draw object to draw on the image. Finally, we save the modified image,\n",
    "    to a file using the save() method as shown in the previous answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Note that the Draw object provides many drawing methods, including line(), rectangle(), ellipse(), polygon(), text(),\n",
    "    and more. These methods take different arguments depending on the shape you want to draw. You can refer to the Pillow,\n",
    "    documentation for more information on the Draw class and its methods.\n",
