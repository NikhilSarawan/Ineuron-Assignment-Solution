    "1. Explain One-Hot Encoding\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "One-hot encoding is a method used to represent categorical data, typically in the context of machine learning and\n",
    "natural language processing. It converts categorical variables into binary vectors where each unique category is \n",
    "represented by a binary code. Here's how it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Assigning an index:** Each unique category in the categorical variable is assigned a unique index. For example,\n",
    "    if you have three categories A, B, and C, you might assign them indices 0, 1, and 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Binary vector representation:** For each data point in the categorical variable, a binary vector is created. \n",
    "    The length of the vector is equal to the number of unique categories. All elements of the vector are set to 0,\n",
    "    except for the element at the index corresponding to the category of the data point, which is set to 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "   For example, if a data point corresponds to category B, and the indices are assigned as 0, 1, 2, the one-hot \n",
    "encoded vector would be [0, 1, 0].\n",
    "\n",
    "One-hot encoding is commonly used in machine learning algorithms, especially when dealing with categorical features\n",
    "such as class labels in classification problems. It allows algorithms to work with categorical data as if it were numerical, \n",
    "enabling the application of mathematical operations and comparisons.\n",

    "2. Explain Bag of Words\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The Bag of Words (BoW) model is a simple and commonly used technique in natural language processing (NLP) for representing\n",
    "text data. It disregards the order and structure of words in a document and focuses on the frequency of each word. Here's \n",
    "how the Bag of Words model works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Tokenization:** The first step is to break down the text into individual words or tokens. This process involves\n",
    "    removing punctuation, converting text to lowercase, and splitting the text into words.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Vocabulary:** Create a vocabulary, which is a list of all unique words present in the text corpus. Each word in\n",
    "    the vocabulary is assigned a unique index.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Vectorization:** Represent each document as a numerical vector, where each element corresponds to the frequency\n",
    "    of a word from the vocabulary in the document. The length of the vector is equal to the size of the vocabulary.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Word Frequency:** The values in the vector are typically the word frequencies. For example, if the word \"apple\" \n",
    "    appears three times in a document, the corresponding element in the vector would be 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Sparse Matrix:** Since most documents use only a small subset of the words in the vocabulary, the resulting \n",
    "    vectors are usually sparse (contain mostly zeros). This leads to the representation being stored efficiently\n",
    "    in a sparse matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Bag of Words model discards the order of words and only retains information about their frequency in a document. \n",
    "While it is a simple and efficient representation, it doesn't capture semantic relationships between words or the \n",
    "context in which they appear. Despite its limitations, BoW is a foundational concept and is often used as a feature\n",
    "representation in various natural language processing tasks like text classification and sentiment analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Explain Bag of N-Grams\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The Bag of N-Grams model is an extension of the Bag of Words (BoW) model, which takes into account not only individual\n",
    "words but also sequences of adjacent words (n-grams) in a document. While the BoW model considers only unigrams \n",
    "(single words), the Bag of N-Grams model considers all possible consecutive sequences of N words.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how the Bag of N-Grams model works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Tokenization:** As in the Bag of Words model, the text is tokenized into individual words.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **N-Gram Generation:** Instead of considering only individual words, the model considers all possible sequences of\n",
    "    N adjacent words. For example:\n",
    "   - Unigrams (N = 1): \"This,\" \"is,\" \"an,\" \"example.\"\n",
    "   - Bigrams (N = 2): \"This is,\" \"is an,\" \"an example.\"\n",
    "   - Trigrams (N = 3): \"This is an,\" \"is an example.\"\n",
    "   - And so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Vocabulary:** Create a vocabulary based on these n-grams, assigning a unique index to each unique n-gram in the\n",
    "    corpus.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Vectorization:** Represent each document as a numerical vector, where each element corresponds to the frequency of \n",
    "    an n-gram from the vocabulary in the document.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Word Frequency:** The values in the vector represent the frequency of each n-gram in the document.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to the Bag of Words model, the resulting vectors are often sparse, especially when considering higher-order\n",
    "n-grams.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bag of N-Grams captures more contextual information than Bag of Words, allowing the model to consider the order of \n",
    "words to some extent. However, it still lacks the ability to capture long-range dependencies and semantic relationships \n",
    "between words. The choice of the value of N (the size of the n-grams) depends on the specific application and the\n",
    "characteristics of the text data being analyzed.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Explain TF-IDF\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "TF-IDF stands for Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency. It is a numerical statistic that reflects the importance of\n",
    "a word in a document relative to a collection of documents (corpus). TF-IDF is commonly used in information retrieval and\n",
    "text mining to represent the significance of terms in a document.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how TF-IDF is calculated:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Term Frequency (TF):**\n",
    "   - It measures how often a term (word) appears in a document.\n",
    "   - It is calculated as the ratio of the number of times a term appears in a document to the total number of terms in the\n",
    "     document.\n",
    "   - Mathematically, \\[ \\text{TF}(t, d) = \\frac{\\text{Number of times term } t \\text{ appears in document } d}{\\text{Total\n",
    "     number of terms in document } d} \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Inverse Document Frequency (IDF):**\n",
    "   - It measures the importance of a term across a collection of documents.\n",
    "   - It is calculated as the logarithm of the ratio of the total number of documents to the number of documents containing\n",
    "     the term, with a smoothing term to avoid division by zero.\n",
    "   - Mathematically, \\[ \\text{IDF}(t, D) = \\log\\left(\\frac{\\text{Total number of documents in the corpus }\n",
    "                                        |D|}{\\text{Number of documents containing term } t + 1}\\right) \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **TF-IDF Score:**\n",
    "   - The TF-IDF score for a term in a document is the product of its TF and IDF scores.\n",
    "   - Mathematically, \\[ \\text{TF-IDF}(t, d, D) = \\text{TF}(t, d) \\times \\text{IDF}(t, D) \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "The TF-IDF score reflects how important a word is to a document in the context of a larger corpus. Words that appear \n",
    "frequently in a document but not in many documents across the corpus receive higher TF-IDF scores, indicating their \n",
    "significance in describing the content of that document.\n",
    "\n",
    "TF-IDF is often used as a feature representation for text data in various natural language processing tasks such as\n",
    "text classification, information retrieval, and document similarity analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. What is OOV problem?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "OOV stands for \"Out-Of-Vocabulary,\" and the OOV problem refers to the challenge of encountering words in new, unseen\n",
    "data that were not present in the vocabulary used during training in natural language processing (NLP) models. This\n",
    "is a common issue when working with language models, especially in scenarios where the language evolves over time,\n",
    "or the model is applied to new and diverse datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some key points related to the OOV problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Vocabulary Limitation:** During the training of language models like those based on machine learning or deep\n",
    "    learning, a fixed vocabulary is typically defined based on the words present in the training dataset. Words outside\n",
    "    this vocabulary are considered out-of-vocabulary.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **OOV in Inference:** When the trained model is applied to new, unseen text during inference (testing or real-world use),\n",
    "    it might encounter words that were not part of the training vocabulary. This can lead to challenges in effectively \n",
    "    processing and understanding the new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Handling OOV:** Dealing with the OOV problem is crucial for the robustness and generalization of language models. \n",
    "    Some common strategies to address the OOV problem include:\n",
    "   - **Unknown Token:** Replace OOV words with a special \"unknown\" token during inference.\n",
    "   - **Subword Tokenization:** Use techniques like subword tokenization to break words into smaller units, which can \n",
    "    help handle unseen words or variations.\n",
    "   - **Retraining:** Periodically retrain models with updated datasets to incorporate new words and language variations.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Impact on Performance:** The OOV problem can impact the performance of various NLP tasks, such as text classification,\n",
    "    language modeling, and machine translation. Models that effectively handle OOV words are more likely to generalize well\n",
    "    to diverse and evolving language patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Addressing the OOV problem is an ongoing challenge in NLP, especially as models are deployed in real-world applications\n",
    "where they encounter diverse and dynamic language data. Researchers and practitioners continue to explore innovative\n",
    "solutions to mitigate the impact of OOV and enhance the adaptability of language models.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "6. What are word embeddings?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Word embeddings are dense vector representations of words in a continuous vector space, where semantically similar words\n",
    "are mapped to nearby points. Unlike traditional methods of representing words as discrete symbols or one-hot encoded \n",
    "vectors, word embeddings capture semantic relationships and contextual information about words.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some key points about word embeddings:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Dense Vector Representation:** In word embeddings, each word is represented by a fixed-size, continuous vector of \n",
    "    real numbers. These vectors have a lower dimensionality compared to the high-dimensional and sparse one-hot encoded\n",
    "    vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Semantic Similarity:** Words with similar meanings or used in similar contexts have vectors that are closer\n",
    "    together in the embedding space. This property allows word embeddings to capture semantic relationships and \n",
    "    similarities between words.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Contextual Information:** Word embeddings are often learned from large text corpora using unsupervised learning \n",
    "    techniques, such as Word2Vec, GloVe (Global Vectors for Word Representation), or more recently, transformer-based\n",
    "    models like BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers). These models take into account the\n",
    "    context in which words appear, allowing them to capture syntactic and semantic information.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Pre-trained Embeddings:** Word embeddings can be pre-trained on large datasets and then transferred to specific\n",
    "    NLP tasks. This transfer learning approach has proven to be effective in tasks such as sentiment analysis, named\n",
    "    entity recognition, and machine translation.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Word Arithmetic:** Word embeddings exhibit interesting properties, such as the ability to perform semantic arithmetic.\n",
    "    For example, the vector representation of \"king\" minus \"man\" plus \"woman\" might be close to the vector representation\n",
    "    of \"queen.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Applications:** Word embeddings are widely used in natural language processing tasks, including machine translation, \n",
    "    sentiment analysis, document similarity, and more. They have become a fundamental component in the development of\n",
    "    sophisticated language models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Popular word embedding models include Word2Vec, GloVe, and fastText. These embeddings have greatly contributed to the\n",
    "improvement of NLP models by providing a more meaningful and semantically rich representation of words in continuous \n",
    "vector spaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Explain Continuous bag of words (CBOW)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Continuous Bag of Words (CBOW) is a type of word embedding model used in natural language processing (NLP). It is a part of\n",
    "the Word2Vec family of models, which are designed to learn distributed representations of words in a continuous vector space. \n",
    "CBOW focuses on predicting a target word based on its context.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how CBOW works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Context Window:** CBOW considers a fixed-size context window around a target word. The context window is the set of\n",
    "    words that precede and follow the target word in a given sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Objective:** The main objective of CBOW is to predict the target word given its context. Unlike other language models\n",
    "    that predict the next word in a sequence (like in a traditional language model or the Skip-Gram model), CBOW predicts \n",
    "    the target word using the surrounding context.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Input Representation:** The input to CBOW is the one-hot encoded vectors of the words within the context window. \n",
    "    These one-hot encoded vectors are used as input to a neural network.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Hidden Layer:** CBOW typically has a single hidden layer between the input and output layers. The hidden layer has\n",
    "    a smaller dimensionality than the input and output layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Output Layer:** The output layer produces a probability distribution over the entire vocabulary, indicating the\n",
    "    likelihood of each word being the target word given the context.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Training:** CBOW is trained using a dataset where the input consists of context words, and the target is the \n",
    "    central word. The model is trained to minimize the difference between its predicted probability distribution and\n",
    "    the actual distribution (one-hot encoded vector) of the target word.\n",
    "\n",
    "The training process involves adjusting the weights in the neural network to improve the model's ability to predict \n",
    "the target word based on its context. The learned weights in the hidden layer become the word embeddings, capturing\n",
    "the semantic relationships and contextual information of words.\n",
    "\n",
    "CBOW is known for its efficiency in training, especially on smaller datasets, and it tends to work well when the\n",
    "context is sufficient for predicting the target word accurately. However, it might not capture complex semantic \n",
    "relationships as effectively as some other models, such as Skip-Gram. The choice between CBOW and Skip-Gram often \n",
    "depends on the characteristics of the specific NLP task and the nature of the available data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Explain SkipGram\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Skip-Gram is another word embedding model belonging to the Word2Vec family, designed for learning distributed \n",
    "representations of words in a continuous vector space. Unlike Continuous Bag of Words (CBOW), which predicts a \n",
    "target word given its context, Skip-Gram does the opposite – it predicts the context words given a target word.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how Skip-Gram works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Objective:** The main goal of Skip-Gram is to predict the context words (surrounding words) based on a given\n",
    "    target word.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Input Representation:** Given a target word, Skip-Gram takes the one-hot encoded vector of that word as input.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Hidden Layer:** Skip-Gram typically has a single hidden layer between the input and output layers. The hidden \n",
    "    layer has a smaller dimensionality than the input and output layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Output Layer:** The output layer produces a probability distribution over the entire vocabulary, indicating the \n",
    "    likelihood of each word being a context word given the target word.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Training:** Skip-Gram is trained using a dataset where the input is the one-hot encoded vector of a target word,\n",
    "    and the output is a probability distribution over the vocabulary representing the likelihood of each word being a \n",
    "    context word. The model is trained to minimize the difference between its predicted probability distribution and\n",
    "    the actual distribution (one-hot encoded vectors) of the context words.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Word Embeddings:** Similar to CBOW, the weights learned in the hidden layer during training become the word embeddings.\n",
    "    These embeddings capture the semantic relationships and contextual information of words.\n",
    "\n",
    "Skip-Gram tends to perform well when the focus is on capturing fine-grained semantic relationships and syntactic structures\n",
    "within a text. It is often preferred when working with larger datasets or when the context is complex and diverse.\n",
    "\n",
    "While CBOW and Skip-Gram have different training objectives, they often result in similar word embeddings. The choice\n",
    "between the two models depends on the specific requirements of the NLP task at hand and the characteristics of the \n",
    "available data. Skip-Gram is known for performing well on tasks where capturing the semantics of words and their \n",
    "relationships is crucial.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Explain Glove Embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "GloVe, which stands for \"Global Vectors for Word Representation,\" is an unsupervised learning algorithm for obtaining\n",
    "word embeddings. It was introduced by researchers at Stanford University. GloVe is designed to capture the global \n",
    "statistical information about the co-occurrences of words in a large corpus of text to generate meaningful word \n",
    "representations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an overview of how GloVe embeddings work:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Co-Occurrence Matrix:** GloVe starts by constructing a global co-occurrence matrix \\(X\\), where each element \n",
    "    \\(X_{ij}\\) represents the number of times word \\(i\\) co-occurs with word \\(j\\) in the entire corpus.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Word Probabilities:** From the co-occurrence matrix, GloVe computes the probability distributions \\(P(i)\\) and\n",
    "    \\(P(j|i)\\). \\(P(i)\\) represents the probability of encountering word \\(i\\) in the corpus, and \\(P(j|i)\\)\n",
    "    represents the probability of encountering word \\(j\\) given that word \\(i\\) has occurred.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Objective Function:** The goal of GloVe is to learn word embeddings that minimize a certain objective function. \n",
    "    The objective is to learn vectors \\(w_i\\) and \\(w_j\\) for each word \\(i\\) and \\(j\\) such that their dot product \n",
    "    captures the logarithm of the co-occurrence probability:\n",
    "\n",
    "   \\[ J = \\sum_{i, j} f(X_{ij}) \\left(w_i^T \\tilde{w}_j + b_i + \\tilde{b}_j - \\log(X_{ij})\\right)^2 \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "   Here, \\(f(X_{ij})\\) is a weighting term that helps emphasize the importance of different co-occurrence pairs. \n",
    "    The vectors \\(w_i\\) and \\(\\tilde{w}_j\\) are the word embeddings, and \\(b_i\\) and \\(\\tilde{b}_j\\) are bias terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Training:** GloVe uses gradient descent to minimize the objective function by updating the word vectors and \n",
    "    biases iteratively.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Word Embeddings:** The learned word vectors represent the semantic relationships between words based on their\n",
    "    co-occurrence patterns. Similar to other word embedding methods, these vectors capture semantic similarity and \n",
    "    can be used in various natural language processing tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "GloVe embeddings are often pre-trained on large text corpora and can be used as features in downstream NLP tasks.\n",
    "They are known for producing high-quality word representations that capture both syntactic and semantic relationships. \n",
    "GloVe embeddings have been widely adopted in the NLP community and are often used in conjunction with neural network \n",
    "models for various language understanding tasks.\n",
