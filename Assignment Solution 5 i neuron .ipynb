    "## 1. What does an empty dictionary's code look like?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-.An empty dictionary code looks like this: {}.\n",
    "    \n",
    "## 2. What is the value of a dictionary value with the key 'foo' and the value 42?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-.The value of a dictionary value with the key 'foo' and the value 42 is 42.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. What is the most significant distinction between a dictionary and a list?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-.The most significant distinction between a dictionary and a list is that a dictionary is an unordered collection,\n",
    "    of key-value pairs,whereas a list is an ordered collection of elements.\n",
    "    \n",
    "## 4. What happens if you try to access spam['foo'] if spam is {'bar': 100}?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-.If you try to access spam['foo'] if spam is {'bar': 100},\n",
    "    you will get a KeyError because 'foo' is not a key in the dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. If a dictionary is stored in spam, what is the difference between the expressions 'cat' in spam and 'cat' in spam.keys()?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-.Now, let's look at the difference between the expressions 'cat' in spam and 'cat' in spam.keys():\n",
    "\n",
    "    'cat' in spam:  This expression checks if the dictionary spam contains the Key 'cat'. If 'cat' is key in the dictionary,\n",
    "    the expression will evaluate to True. Otherwise, it will evaluate to False. In our example,'cat' in spam would evaluate to\n",
    "    True since 'cat' is in the dictionary.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    'cat' in spam.keys():  This expression checks if the dictionary spam contains the key 'cat' in its keys. \n",
    "    If 'cat' is a key in the dictionary, the expression will evaluate to True. Otherwise, it will evaluate to False.\n",
    "    In our example, 'cat' in spam.keys() would also evaluate to True since 'cat' is a key in the dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. If a dictionary is stored in spam, what is the difference between the expressions 'cat' in spam and 'cat' in spam.values()?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-.The difference between the expressions 'cat' in spam and 'cat' in spam.values():\n",
    "\n",
    "    'cat' in spam: This expression checks if the dictionary spam contains the key 'cat'. If 'cat' is a key in the dictionary, \n",
    "    the expression will evaluate to True. Otherwise, it will evaluate to False. In our example, \n",
    "    'cat' in spam would evaluate to True since 'cat' is a key in the dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "    'cat' in spam.values(): This expression checks if the dictionary spam contains the value 'cat' in its values.\n",
    "    If 'cat' is a value in the dictionary, the expression will evaluate to True. Otherwise, it will evaluate to False.\n",
    "    In our example, 'cat' in spam.values() would evaluate to False since 'cat' is not a value in the dictionary.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "## 7. What is a shortcut for the following code?\n",
    "    if 'color' not in spam:\n",
    "    spam['color'] = 'black'\n",
    "    \n",
    "Ans-.A shortcut for the following code is: spam.setdefault('color', 'black')\n",
    "\n",
    "## 8. How do you \"pretty print\" dictionary values using which module and function?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-.You can \"pretty print\" dictionary values using the \"pprint\" module's\n",
    "    \"pprint\" function. For example, you can import the module and use the function like this:\n",
    "    import pprint\n",
    "    \n",
    "    my_dict = {'name': 'John', 'age': 25, 'city': 'New York'}\n",
    "    pprint.pprint(my_dict)\n"
