    "## 1. What exactly is []?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-.[] is an empty list in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. In a list of values stored in a variable called spam, how would you assign the value 'hello' as the third value? (Assume [2, 4, 6, 8, 10] are in spam.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-.To assign the value 'hello' as the third value in the list stored in the variable spam, you can use the following code:\n",
    "     spam[2] = 'hello'\n",
    "    -This will change the list to [2, 4, 'hello', 8, 10].  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##Let's pretend the spam includes the list ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'] for the next three queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. What is the value of spam[int(int('3' * 2) / 11)]?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-.The value of spam[int(int('3' * 2) / 11)] is 'd'.First, the string '3' is multiplied by 2 to get '33', \n",
    "     which is then converted to an integer and divided by 11 to get 3. The expression then becomes spam[3],\n",
    "     which corresponds to the fourth element of the list ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'].\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. What is the value of spam[-1]?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-.The value of spam[-1] is 'd', which is the last element in the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. What is the value of spam[:2]?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-.The value of spam[:2] is ['a', 'b'], which is a new list containing the first two elements of the original list.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##Let's pretend bacon has the list [3.14, 'cat,' 11, 'cat,' True] for the next three questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. What is the value of bacon.index('cat')?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-.The value of bacon.index('cat') is 1.\n",
    "    This method returns the index of the first occurrence of the specified value in the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7. How does bacon.append(99) change the look of the list value in bacon?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-.After bacon.append(99), the list value in bacon would be [3.14, 'cat', 11, 'cat', True, 99].\n",
    "    The append() method adds the specified element to the end of the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 8. How does bacon.remove('cat') change the look of the list in bacon?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-.After bacon.remove('cat'), the list value in bacon would be [3.14, 11, 'cat', True]. \n",
    "    The remove() method removes the first occurrence of the specified value from the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "## 9. What are the list concatenation and list replication operators?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-.The list concatenation operator is +, which combines two lists into a new list. The list replication operator is *, \n",
    "    which repeats a list a specified number of times to create a new list.\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "## 10. What is difference between the list methods append() and insert()?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-.The append() method adds an element to the end of the list, while the insert() method adds an element at a specified index,\n",
    "    shifting existing elements to the right.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 11. What are the two methods for removing items from a list?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-.The two methods for removing items from a list are remove() and pop(). \n",
    "    The remove() method removes the first occurrence of a specified value, \n",
    "    while the pop() method removes an element at a specified index and returns its value.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 12. Describe how list values and string values are identical.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-.List values and string values are similar in that they are both ordered sequences of values.\n",
    "    They can be indexed and sliced, and they support many of the same methods, such as len(), min(), and max().However,\n",
    "    unlike strings, list values can be modified and can contain elements of different types.\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "## 13. What's the difference between tuples and lists?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-.Tuples and lists are both ordered sequences of values, but tuples are immutable while lists are mutable.\n",
    "    Tuples are defined using parentheses ( ) while lists are defined using square brackets [ ].\n",
    "\n",
    "## 14. How do you type a tuple value that only contains the integer 42?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-.To create a tuple value that only contains the integer 42, you can use the following code:\n",
    "    my_tuple = (42,)\n",
    "    The comma is necessary to differentiate between a tuple and an integer surrounded by parentheses.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 15. How do you get a list value's tuple form? How do you get a tuple value's list form?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-.To get a list value in tuple form, you can use the tuple() function. For example:\n",
    "    my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "    my_tuple = tuple(my_list)\n",
    "    To get a tuple value in list form, you can use the list() function. For example:\n",
    "    my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)\n",
    "    my_list = list(my_tuple)\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 16. Variables that \"contain\" list values are not necessarily lists themselves. Instead, what do they contain?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-.In Python, a variable that \"contains\" list values can be a reference to a list object, rather than a list itself.\n",
    "    This means that the variable stores a memory address that points to where the list is stored in memory,rather than the\n",
    "    list data itself. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##17. How do you distinguish between copy.copy() and copy.deepcopy()?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-.In Python copy module, copy.copy() and copy.deepcopy() are both used to create copies of objects. However,\n",
    "    they differ in how they handle nested objects (e.g. lists within lists).\n",
    "    copy.copy() creates a shallow copy of an object, which means that it creates a new object with a new memory address,\n",
    "    but the nested objects within the original object are still referenced by the new object. \n",
    "    This can be illustrated with an example:\n",
    "       \n",
    "    import copy\n",
    "    list_a = [1, [2, 3]]\n",
    "    list_b = copy.copy(list_a)\n",
    "\n",
    "    list_a[1].append(4)\n",
    "    print(list_b)  # Output: [1, [2, 3, 4]]\n",
    "    \n",
    "    n this case, list_b is a shallow copy of list_a, so when we modify the nested list within list_a,\n",
    "    the change is also reflected in list_b\n",
    "    \n",
    "    copy.deepcopy() creates a deep copy of an object, which means that it creates a new object with new memory \n",
    "    addresses for all of the nested objects within the original object. This can be illustrated with an example:\n",
    "    import copy\n",
    "\n",
    "    list_a = [1, [2, 3]]\n",
    "    list_b = copy.deepcopy(list_a)\n",
    "\n",
    "    list_a[1].append(4)\n",
    "    print(list_b)  # Output: [1, [2, 3]]\n",
    "    \n",
    "    In this case, list_b is a deep copy of list_a, so when we modify the nested list within list_a,\n",
    "    the change is not reflected in list_b.\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
