    "Q1. What is the difference between __getattr__ and __getattribute__?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-\n",
    "\n",
    "`__getattr__` and `__getattribute__` are both special methods in Python classes, but they serve different purposes:\n",
    "\n",
    "### `__getattr__(self, name)`\n",
    "\n",
    "- `__getattr__` is called when an attribute that doesn't exist is accessed.\n",
    "- It takes two parameters: `self` (the instance) and `name` (the name of the attribute being accessed).\n",
    "- If `__getattr__` is defined in a class, it is called when you try to access an attribute that\n",
    "doesn't exist for an instance of that class.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Example:\n",
    "    def __getattr__(self, name):\n",
    "        print(f\"Accessing undefined attribute: {name}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "obj = Example()\n",
    "obj.undefined_attribute  # Output: \"Accessing undefined attribute: undefined_attribute\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### `__getattribute__(self, name)`\n",
    "\n",
    "- `__getattribute__` is called every time an attribute is accessed, regardless of whether the attribute exists or not.\n",
    "- It takes two parameters: `self` (the instance) and `name` (the name of the attribute being accessed).\n",
    "- If `__getattribute__` is defined in a class, it intercepts every attribute access and allows you to\n",
    "customize attribute retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Example:\n",
    "    def __getattribute__(self, name):\n",
    "        print(f\"Accessing attribute: {name}\")\n",
    "        return super().__getattribute__(name)\n",
    "\n",
    "obj = Example()\n",
    "obj.existing_attribute  # Output: \"Accessing attribute: existing_attribute\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the second example, `__getattribute__` intercepts all attribute accesses and prints a message.\n",
    "It then calls `super().__getattribute__(name)` to retrieve the actual attribute, allowing normal attribute access to occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, `__getattr__` is specifically used for handling undefined attributes, while `__getattribute__` \n",
    "intercepts all attribute accesses, including defined attributes, allowing you to customize the behavior of attribute retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. What is the difference between properties and descriptors?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Properties and descriptors are both mechanisms in Python for controlling access to an object's\n",
    "attributes. While they serve similar purposes, there are some key differences between them:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Simpler Syntax:**\n",
    "   - Properties are created using the `property` built-in function or the `@property` decorator.\n",
    "They provide a simple way to define getter, setter, and deleter methods for attribute access.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Per-Attribute Control:**\n",
    "   - Properties allow you to define getter, setter, and deleter methods for specific attributes of an object.\n",
    "You can control access, modification, and deletion of individual attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Limited Reusability:**\n",
    "   - Properties are attached to specific attributes of a class. While they provide a convenient way to control\n",
    "access for specific attributes, they are not easily reusable across different classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Example:\n",
    "    def __init__(self):\n",
    "        self._value = 0\n",
    "    \n",
    "    @property\n",
    "    def value(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Getting value\")\n",
    "        return self._value\n",
    "    \n",
    "    @value.setter\n",
    "    def value(self, new_value):\n",
    "        print(\"Setting value\")\n",
    "        self._value = new_value\n",
    "\n",
    "obj = Example()\n",
    "obj.value  # Calls the getter method\n",
    "obj.value = 42  # Calls the setter method\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Descriptors:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Versatility and Reusability:**\n",
    "   - Descriptors are more versatile and reusable than properties. They are classes that define the `__get__`, `__set__`,\n",
    "and/or `__delete__` methods. Descriptors can be reused across different classes and attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Class-Level Control:**\n",
    "   - Descriptors provide class-level control for attribute access. When you define a descriptor, it can be used to \n",
    "control multiple attributes across different instances of a class.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Fine-Grained Control:**\n",
    "   - Descriptors offer fine-grained control over attribute access, allowing you to customize behavior at a lower level.\n",
    "For example, you can control access based on the instance, class, or even the attribute name.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Descriptor:\n",
    "    def __get__(self, instance, owner):\n",
    "        print(\"Getting value\")\n",
    "        return instance._value\n",
    "    \n",
    "    def __set__(self, instance, value):\n",
    "        print(\"Setting value\")\n",
    "        instance._value = value\n",
    "\n",
    "class Example:\n",
    "    def __init__(self):\n",
    "        self._value = 0\n",
    "    \n",
    "    value = Descriptor()\n",
    "\n",
    "obj = Example()\n",
    "obj.value  # Calls the descriptor's getter method\n",
    "obj.value = 42  # Calls the descriptor's setter method\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, properties provide a convenient way to control access to specific attributes, while descriptors \n",
    "offer more versatility, reusability, and fine-grained control over attribute access, making them suitable for\n",
    "more complex scenarios and codebases. The choice between properties and descriptors depends on the complexity \n",
    "and requirements of your application.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. What are the key differences in functionality between __getattr__ and __getattribute__, as well as\n",
    "properties and descriptors?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-\n",
    "\n",
    "The functions `__getattr__` and `__getattribute__`, as well as properties and descriptors, are mechanisms in\n",
    "Python that allow you to control attribute access. Each of them has different use cases and functionalities. \n",
    "Let's explore the key differences in functionality between these methods and mechanisms:\n",
    "\n",
    "### `__getattr__` vs. `__getattribute__`:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `__getattr__(self, name)`:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Functionality:**\n",
    "  - `__getattr__` is called when an attribute that does not exist is accessed.\n",
    "  - It is specific to undefined attributes and is not called for existing attributes.\n",
    "- **Use Case:**\n",
    "  - It is typically used to define behavior for attributes that are not directly present in the object but\n",
    "can be computed or fetched dynamically.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `__getattribute__(self, name)`:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Functionality:**\n",
    "  - `__getattribute__` is called for every attribute access, regardless of whether the attribute exists or not.\n",
    "  - It intercepts all attribute access attempts, including both defined and undefined attributes.\n",
    "- **Use Case:**\n",
    "  - It provides a general mechanism for intercepting attribute access and can be used for various purposes, \n",
    "such as logging, validation, and access control.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Properties vs. Descriptors:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Functionality:**\n",
    "  - Properties are a built-in way to define getter, setter, and deleter methods for specific attributes.\n",
    "  - They provide a high-level and convenient interface for controlling access to individual attributes.\n",
    "- **Use Case:**\n",
    "  - Use properties when you want a simple way to manage specific attributes with custom access logic, \n",
    "especially if the logic involves calculations or validation checks.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Descriptors:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Functionality:**\n",
    "  - Descriptors are custom-defined classes that implement `__get__`, `__set__`, and/or `__delete__` methods.\n",
    "  - They allow you to intercept attribute access at a lower level, providing fine-grained control over attribute behavior.\n",
    "- **Use Case:**\n",
    "  - Use descriptors when you need reusable and versatile attribute access control. Descriptors can be \n",
    "shared across multiple attributes and classes, making them suitable for complex applications with specific \n",
    "attribute access requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Differences:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Granularity:**\n",
    "   - `__getattr__` and properties operate at the attribute level, allowing you to control access for specific attributes.\n",
    "   - `__getattribute__` and descriptors operate at a more general level, allowing you to control access for \n",
    "    all attributes and intercept attribute access attempts globally.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Reusability:**\n",
    "   - Properties are specific to the class they are defined in, providing attribute-level control but limited reusability.\n",
    "   - Descriptors can be defined once and reused across multiple attributes and classes, offering more versatility\n",
    "    and reusability.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Control Level:**\n",
    "   - Properties provide a high-level interface for attribute access control, suitable for most common use cases.\n",
    "   - Descriptors provide a low-level interface, allowing you to customize attribute access behavior in complex and\n",
    "    specific scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "In summary, the choice between `__getattr__`, `__getattribute__`, properties, and descriptors depends on the \n",
    "granularity of control and the complexity of the application. Use `__getattr__` and properties for simpler \n",
    "cases where you need specific attribute-level control. Use `__getattribute__` and descriptors for more complex\n",
    "scenarios where fine-grained and versatile control over attribute access is required.\n",
