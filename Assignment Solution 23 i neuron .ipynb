    "##1. What is the result of the code, and why?\n",
    ">>> def func(a, b=6, c=8):\n",
    "print(a, b, c)\n",
    ">>> func(1, 2)\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-.The code defines a function func that takes three parameters: a, b, and c. The b and c parameters have default values ,\n",
    "    of 6 and 8, respectively, which means they can be omitted when calling the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The code then calls the func function and passes two arguments: 1 and 2. Since a is the first parameter and has no default,\n",
    "    value, the value 1 is assigned to a. The value 2 is assigned to b, because it is the second parameter and there is no,\n",
    "    keyword argument associated with it. Since c has a default value of 8 and no other value was passed, it retains its,\n",
    "    default value.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Therefore, the expected output of this code is:\n",
    "        \n",
    "    1 2 8\n",
    "    The print statement inside the func function prints the values of a, b, and c, in that order, \n",

    ">>> func(1, c=3, b=2)\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-.The code defines a function func that takes three parameters: a, b, and c. The c parameter has a default value of 5,\n",
    "    which means it can be omitted when calling the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The code then calls the func function and passes three arguments using keyword arguments: 1 for a, 2 for b, and 3 for c. \n",
    "    Since the argument for b comes after the argument for c, the b parameter is assigned the value 2, and the c parameter ,\n",
    "    is assigned the value 3, overriding the default value of 5.\n",

    "    Therefore, the expected output of this code is:\n",

    "\n",
    "Ans-.The code defines a function func that takes a mandatory argument a and an arbitrary number of positional arguments pargs.\n",
    "    The * before pargs in the function definition allows the function to accept any number of positional arguments, \n",

    "\n",
    "    The code then calls the func function and passes three arguments: 1, 2, and 3. Since the first argument is assigned,\n",

    "    assigned to pargs.\n",

    "    Therefore, the expected output of this code is:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    1 (2, 3)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    The print statement inside the func function prints the value of a, followed by the tuple of positional arguments pargs.\n",

    "\n",
    "    Therefore, the expected output of this code is:\n",
    "    \n",

    "    The print statement inside the func function prints the value of a, followed by the dictionary of keyword arguments kargs. \n",

    "Ans-.In this code, the func function takes four arguments: a, b, c (with a default value of 8), and d,\n",
    "    (with a default value of 5). The function prints the values of these arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The function is then called with two positional arguments: 1 and *(5,6). The *(5,6) syntax is a way of,\n",
    "    unpacking the tuple (5,6) and passing its elements as separate positional arguments to the function. So the function ,\n",
    "    call is equivalent to func(1, 5, 6). The value 1 is assigned to the first parameter a, and the values 5 and 6 are ,\n",
    "    assigned to the second and third parameters b and c, respectively. Since there is no fourth argument passed, the default,\n",
    "    value of d is used, which is 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Therefore, the expected output of this code is:\n",
    "    1 5 6 5\n",
