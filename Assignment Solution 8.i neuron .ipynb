    "## 1. Is the Python Standard Library included with PyInputPlus?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-.PyInputPlus is a third-party library for Python that provides additional functionality for taking user input.\n",
    "    While it uses some modules from the Python Standard Library, it is not a part of the standard library itself.\n",
    "    For example, the sys module from the Python Standard Library is used by PyInputPlus to handle keyboard interrupts.\n",
    "    However, PyInputPlus is not included with the Python Standard Library, and you need to install it separately using,\n",
    "    a package manager like pip.\n",
    "    To install PyInputPlus using pip, you can run the following command in your terminal:\n",
    "        pip install pyinputplus\n",
    "    After installing PyInputPlus, you can import it into your Python scripts and use its functions to take user input with,\n",
    "    additional features like input validation and time limits. For example:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    import pyinputplus as pypi\n",
    "\n",
    "    name = pypi.inputStr(\"What is your name? \")\n",
    "    age = pypi.inputInt(\"How old are you? \")\n",
    "    \n",
    "    In the above example, PyInputPlus is imported as pypi using the as keyword to create a shorter alias for the module name.\n",
    "    The inputStr function is used to take a string input from the user, while the inputInt function is used to take an integer,\n",
    "    input. Both functions include validation checks to ensure that the user input meets certain criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Why is PyInputPlus commonly imported with import pyinputplus as pypi? \n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-.PyInputPlus is commonly imported with the alias pypi using the import ... as ... syntax to create a shorter and more,\n",
    "    convenient name for the module. This makes it easier to use PyInputPlus functions in your code without having to type out ,\n",
    "    the full module name every time.\n",
    "\n",
    "    For example, instead of writing pyinputplus.inputInt() every time you want to use the inputInt() function, you can simply\n",
    "    write pypi.inputInt(). This makes the code shorter and easier to read, especially when you are using PyInputPlus functions,\n",
    "    frequently.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Here is an example of how you can import PyInputPlus using the as keyword:\n",
    "    import pyinputplus as pypi\n",
    "\n",
    "    name = pypi.inputStr(\"What is your name? \")\n",
    "    age = pypi.inputInt(\"How old are you? \")\n",
    "    \n",
    "    In the above example, PyInputPlus is imported as pypi, which allows us to use its functions with the pypi. \n",
    "    prefix instead of pyinputplus. This makes the code shorter and more readable, especially when we need to use PyInputPlus,\n",
    "    functions multiple times.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. How do you distinguish between inputInt() and inputFloat()?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-.inputInt() and inputFloat() are two functions in PyInputPlus that are used to take integer and floating-point number,\n",
    "    inputs from the user, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Here's how you can distinguish between the two:\n",
    "\n",
    "    inputInt(): This function is used to take an integer input from the user. It will only accept whole numbers,\n",
    "    and will raise a PyInputPlus.ValidationException if the user enters a non-integer value. By default, \n",
    "    it will also raise an exception if the user enters a number outside the range of -2147483648 to 2147483647\n",
    "    (which are the minimum and maximum values for a 32-bit signed integer). You can customize the minimum and maximum,\n",
    "    values using the min and max parameters, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "    inputFloat(): This function is used to take a floating-point number input from the user. \n",
    "    It will accept both whole numbers and numbers with decimal places. If the user enters a non-numeric value, \n",
    "    it will raise a PyInputPlus.ValidationException. By default, it will also raise an exception if the user enters a number,\n",
    "    outside the range of -3.4028235e+38 to 3.4028235e+38 (which are the minimum and maximum values for a 32-bit floating-point\n",
    "    number). You can customize the minimum and maximum values using the min and max parameters, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Here's an example of how you can use inputInt() and inputFloat():\n",
    "    import pyinputplus as pypi\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Take an integer input\n",
    "    age = pypi.inputInt(\"Enter your age: \")\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Take a floating-point number input\n",
    "    weight = pypi.inputFloat(\"Enter your weight in kg: \")\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "    In the above example, inputInt() is used to take an integer input from the user for their age, while inputFloat(),\n",
    "    is used to take, a floating-point number input for their weight.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Using PyInputPlus, how do you ensure that the user enters a whole number between 0 and 99?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-.You can use the inputInt() function from PyInputPlus to ensure that the user enters a whole number between 0 and 99 by\n",
    "    specifying the minimum and maximum values using the min and max parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Here's an example:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    import pyinputplus as pypi\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Take an integer input between 0 and 99\n",
    "    number = pypi.inputInt(\"Enter a number between 0 and 99: \", min=0, max=99)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    In the above example, inputInt() is used to take an integer input from the user. The min parameter is set to 0 to ensure,\n",
    "    that the user enters a number greater than or equal to 0, and the max parameter is set to 99 to ensure that the user enters,\n",
    "    a number less than or equal to 99. If the user enters a number outside this range, inputInt() will raise a PyInputPlus.\n",
    "    ValidationException. If the user enters a non-integer value, it will also raise a PyInputPlus.ValidationException.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. What is transferred to the keyword arguments allowRegexes and blockRegexes?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-.The allowRegexes and blockRegexes parameters in PyInputPlus are used to specify regular expressions that allow or block,\n",
    "    certain patterns of input from the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Here's how they work:\n",
    "\n",
    "    allowRegexes: This parameter takes a list of regular expressions that define the patterns of input that are allowed from,\n",
    "    the user. If the user's input matches any of the regular expressions in the list, it will be accepted. If the user's,\n",
    "    input does not match any of the regular expressions in the list, PyInputPlus.ValidationException will be raised.\n",
    "\n",
    "    blockRegexes: This parameter takes a list of regular expressions that define the patterns of input that are not allowed,\n",
    "    from the user. If the user's input matches any of the regular expressions in the list, PyInputPlus.ValidationException,\n",
    "    will be raised. If the user's input does not match any of the regular expressions in the list, it will be accepted.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Here's an example of how to use allowRegexes and blockRegexes:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    import pyinputplus as pypi\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Only allow input that starts with \"a\" or \"b\"\n",
    "    input_str = pypi.inputStr(prompt=\"Enter a string that starts with 'a' or 'b': \", allowRegexes=[\"^a\", \"^b\"])\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Block input that contains the word \"spam\"\n",
    "    input_str2 = pypi.inputStr(prompt=\"Enter a string that does not contain 'spam': \", blockRegexes=[\"spam\"])\n",
    "    \n",
    "    In the above example, the allowRegexes parameter is used to only allow input that starts with the letter \"a\" or \"b\". \n",
    "    The regular expressions ^a and ^b are used to match the start of the input string.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The blockRegexes parameter is used to block input that contains the word \"spam\". The regular expression spam is used,\n",
    "    to match any occurrence of the word \"spam\" in the input string.\n",
    "\n",
    "    By using regular expressions in allowRegexes and blockRegexes, you can define custom patterns of input that are allowed,\n",
    "    or blocked from the user\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. If a blank input is entered three times, what does inputStr(limit=3) do?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-.In a blank input is entered three times, the inputStr(limit=3) function from PyInputPlus will raise a PyInputPlus.\n",
    "    RetryLimitException.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The limit parameter specifies the maximum number of times the user can enter invalid input before inputStr() stops asking,\n",
    "    for input and raises a PyInputPlus.RetryLimitException.\n",
    "\n",
    "    In this case, since the user is entering a blank input, inputStr() considers it as invalid input as it does not match the,\n",
    "    requirement of a non-empty string. Therefore, if the user enters a blank input three times, inputStr(limit=3) will raise a,\n",
    "    PyInputPlus.RetryLimitException after the third attempt.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Here's an example:\n",
    "    import pyinputplus as pypi\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Get a non-empty string input with a limit of 3 tries\n",
    "    input_str = pypi.inputStr(prompt=\"Enter a non-empty string: \", limit=3)\n",
    "\n",
    "    # The program will not reach this line if the user enters a blank input three times\n",
    "    print(\"You entered: \" + input_str)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    In the above example, inputStr() is used to get a non-empty string input from the user. The limit parameter is set to 3,\n",
    "    which means that the user can enter invalid input (in this case, a blank input) a maximum of three times before a,\n",
    "    PyInputPlus.RetryLimitException is raised.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7. If blank input is entered three times, what does inputStr(limit=3, default='hello') do?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-.If blank input is entered three times, the inputStr(limit=3, default='hello') function from PyInputPlus will return the,\n",
    "    default value 'hello' without raising a PyInputPlus.RetryLimitException.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The default parameter specifies the value that should be returned if the user does not provide any input.\n",
    "    If the user enters a blank input, inputStr() will consider it as invalid input and ask the user to provide input again.\n",
    "    However, if the user reaches the limit of retries (in this case, three times), inputStr() will return the default value,\n",
    "    specified in the default parameter instead of raising a PyInputPlus.RetryLimitException.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Here's an example:\n",
    "    import pyinputplus as pypi\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Get a non-empty string input with a limit of 3 tries and a default value of 'hello'\n",
    "    input_str = pypi.inputStr(prompt=\"Enter a non-empty string: \", limit=3, default='hello')\n",
    "\n",
    "    # If the user enters a blank input three times, the default value will be returned\n",
    "    print(\"You entered: \" + input_str)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    In the above example, inputStr() is used to get a non-empty string input from the user. The limit parameter is set to 3, \n",
    "    which means that the user can enter invalid input (in this case, a blank input) a maximum of three times before the ,\n",
    "    returns the default value specified in the default parameter, which is 'hello' in this case.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Note that if the user enters a non-blank input before reaching the limit of retries, the input value will be returned ,\n",
    "    instead ,of the default value.\n"
