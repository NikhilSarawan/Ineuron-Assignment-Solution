    "Q1. What are the two latest user-defined exception constraints in Python 3.X?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As of my last update in September 2021, I cannot provide information on the very latest features or changes ,\n",
    "introduced after that time. Up until Python 3.10, the latest version available at my last update, there were,\n",
    "no specific new user-defined exception constraints introduced. However, it's worth noting that Python constantly,\n",
    "evolves, and new features are added with each release. For the most accurate and updated information, I recommend,\n",
    "checking the official Python documentation or release notes for Python versions released after September 2021.\n",

    "Q2. How are class-based exceptions that have been raised matched to handlers?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, class-based exceptions that have been raised are matched to handlers based on the exception hierarchy.\n",
    "When an exception is raised, Python checks the exception hierarchy to find the most specific handler for the,\n",
    "exception. Here's how it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Exception Hierarchy:** Python exceptions are organized in a hierarchy. At the top of this hierarchy is the ,\n",
    "    base class for all exceptions: the `BaseException` class. Specific exception classes are derived from `BaseException`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`try-except` Blocks:** When an exception is raised inside a `try` block, Python checks the `except` ,\n",
    "    blocks associated with that `try` block. The `except` blocks are checked in the order they appear. \n",
    "    If the raised exception is an instance of the exception class specified in an `except` block, that block is executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    try:\n",
    "        # code that may raise an exception\n",
    "    except SomeSpecificException:\n",
    "        # handle SomeSpecificException\n",
    "    except AnotherSpecificException:\n",
    "        # handle AnotherSpecificException\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Inheritance:** If a specific exception class is not found in the `except` blocks of the current `try` block\n",
    "    Python looks for handlers in the calling code and its parents. This means if the exception is an instance of,\n",
    "    a subclass of the specified exception class, the `except` block associated with the parent class will handle,\n",
    "    the exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    class CustomException(Exception):\n",
    "        pass\n",
    "\n",
    "    try:\n",
    "        # code that may raise CustomException or its subclasses\n",
    "    except CustomException:\n",
    "        # handle CustomException and its subclasses\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the `except CustomException:` block will handle `CustomException` and any of its subclasses since,\n",
    "    they all inherit from the `CustomException` class.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Multiple `except` Blocks:** You can have multiple `except` blocks to handle different exception classes.\n",
    "    Python will execute the first matching `except` block it encounters, so the order of the `except` blocks matters.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    try:\n",
    "        # code that may raise different exceptions\n",
    "    except FirstException:\n",
    "        # handle FirstException\n",
    "    except SecondException:\n",
    "        # handle SecondException\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, if the raised exception is an instance of `FirstException`, the first `except` block will handle it.\n",
    "If it's an instance of `SecondException`, the second `except` block will handle it.\n",
    "\n",
    "By following these rules, Python ensures that exceptions are handled by the appropriate `except` blocks based on ,\n",
    "their inheritance hierarchy, allowing for precise and specific exception handling in your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "Q3. Describe two methods for attaching context information to exception artefacts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "When dealing with exceptions, it's often crucial to attach context information to the exception artifacts,\n",
    "for better understanding and debugging of the issue. Here are two common methods for attaching context ,\n",
    "information to exception artifacts in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Custom Exception Classes with Context Parameters:**\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most straightforward ways to attach context information to exceptions is by creating custom ,\n",
    "exception classes that accept context parameters during initialization. This allows you to provide specific,\n",
    "context information when raising the exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class CustomException(Exception):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, message, context_info=None):\n",
    "        super().__init__(message)\n",
    "        self.context_info = context_info\n",
    "\n",
    "# Raise the custom exception with context information\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    # code that may raise an exception\n",
    "    raise CustomException(\"An error occurred\", context_info={\"key\": \"value\"})\n",
    "except CustomException as e:\n",
    "    print(f\"Caught exception: {e}\")\n",
    "    print(f\"Context info: {e.context_info}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the `CustomException` class takes an additional parameter `context_info` during initialization.\n",
    "When raising the exception, you can pass a dictionary or any relevant context information that provides ,\n",
    "additional details about the exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Exception Chaining with `from` Syntax (Python 3.x and above):**\n",
    "\n",
    "Python 3.x introduced the `from` keyword, which allows you to raise a new exception while preserving the ,\n",
    "context of the original exception. This is useful when you catch an exception and want to raise a new one ,\n",
    "with additional context information without losing information about the original exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    # code that may raise an exception\n",
    "    raise ValueError(\"Invalid value\")\n",
    "except ValueError as original_exception:\n",
    "    # Add context and raise a new exception\n",
    "    new_message = f\"Error processing value: {original_exception}\"\n",
    "    raise CustomException(new_message) from original_exception\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the `CustomException` is raised with additional context information, and the original,\n",
    "exception (`ValueError` in this case) is preserved as the cause of the new exception. This way, you can,\n",
    "track the original exception that led to the new exception, providing a clear understanding of the ,\n",
    "context in which the error occurred.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using these methods, you can attach relevant context information to exceptions, making it easier to ,\n",
    "diagnose and fix issues in your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. Describe two methods for specifying the text of an exception object&#39;s error message.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, there are several ways to specify the text of an exception object's error message. Here are two common methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Custom Exception Classes:**\n",
    "\n",
    "You can create custom exception classes by inheriting from existing exception classes like `Exception`.\n",
    "Within your custom exception class, you can define the error message using the `__init__` method or a custom property.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class CustomException(Exception):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, message=\"Custom Exception Occurred\"):\n",
    "        self.message = message\n",
    "        super().__init__(self.message)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Raise the custom exception with a specific error message\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    raise CustomException(\"This is a custom error message.\")\n",
    "except CustomException as e:\n",
    "    print(f\"Caught exception: {e}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the `CustomException` class is created with a default error message. However,\n",
    "you can override the default message by passing a specific message when raising the exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **String Formatting in `raise` Statement:**\n",
    "\n",
    "When raising a built-in or custom exception, you can use string formatting to specify the error message. \n",
    "This method is especially useful when you want to include dynamic values or variables in the error message.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "value = 42\n",
    "\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    if value < 0:\n",
    "        raise ValueError(\"Invalid value: {}\".format(value))\n",
    "    # Some code that may raise an exception\n",
    "except ValueError as e:\n",
    "    print(f\"Caught exception: {e}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the `ValueError` exception is raised with a specific error message that includes the value,\n",
    "of the `value` variable. String formatting allows you to create informative and dynamic error messages tailored,\n",
    "to the specific situation where the exception is raised.\n",
    "\n",
    "By using custom exception classes or string formatting in the `raise` statement, you can specify the text of an,\n",
    "exception object's error message according to your specific requirements. Choose the method that best suits the,\n",
    "context and readability of your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. Why do you no longer use string-based exceptions?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As of Python 2.6 and later versions, using string-based exceptions is discouraged and considered bad practice.\n",
    "Instead, Python encourages the use of exception classes. There are several reasons for this shift away from,\n",
    "string-based exceptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Clarity and Readability:** Exception classes provide clear and explicit information about the type of,\n",
    "    error that occurred. When you raise or catch an exception using a class, it's immediately apparent what,\n",
    "    kind of error you're dealing with. This improves code readability and makes it easier for other developers,\n",
    "    (or even yourself in the future) to understand the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Consistency:** Using classes for exceptions ensures consistency in the language. Exception classes are,\n",
    "    consistent with other Python classes and follow the object-oriented paradigm of the language.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Inheritance and Hierarchy:** Exception classes can be organized into hierarchies, allowing for more ,\n",
    "    specific exception types to inherit from more general ones. This hierarchy allows for more fine-grained,\n",
    "    exception handling. For example, you can catch a specific type of exception and let more general ,\n",
    "    exceptions propagate up the call stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Customization and Additional Information:** Exception classes can be customized by adding attributes ,\n",
    "    and methods, providing additional information about the exception. This additional information can be,\n",
    "    valuable for debugging and logging purposes, aiding in the identification and resolution of issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Type Checking:** Exception classes allow for type checking and introspection. You can check the type ,\n",
    "    of an exception using `isinstance()` or `try-except` blocks, allowing for more precise exception handling,\n",
    "    based on the type of error.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of how exception handling is done using classes in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class CustomException(Exception):\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    # Code that may raise CustomException\n",
    "    raise CustomException(\"This is a custom exception.\")\n",
    "except CustomException as e:\n",
    "    print(f\"Caught custom exception: {e}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, `CustomException` is a user-defined exception class. When you raise or catch this exception,\n",
    "it's clear that you're dealing with a specific type of error, improving the clarity and maintainability of your code."
