    "Question No 1-      Explain different types of views. Demonstrate with suitable examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-  In the context of databases, \"views\" refer to virtual tables derived from one or more base tables\n",
    "      (actual physical tables) or other views. Views are useful for presenting data in a certain way without changing\n",
    "      the underlying structure of the database. There are several types of views, each serving a specific purpose. \n",
    "      Let's explore some common types of views with examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Simple Views**:\n",
    "   - Simple views are based on a single table and display a subset of its columns or rows.\n",
    "   - Example:\n",
    "     ```sql\n",
    "     CREATE VIEW EmployeeView AS\n",
    "     SELECT EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName\n",
    "     FROM Employees\n",
    "     WHERE Department = 'IT';\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   - This view displays only the ID, first name, and last name of employees working in the IT department.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Complex Views**:\n",
    "   - Complex views involve multiple tables and often include joins or aggregations.\n",
    "   - Example:\n",
    "     ```sql\n",
    "     CREATE VIEW SalesSummary AS\n",
    "     SELECT p.ProductName, SUM(s.Quantity) AS TotalSold\n",
    "     FROM Products p\n",
    "     INNER JOIN Sales s ON p.ProductID = s.ProductID\n",
    "     GROUP BY p.ProductName;\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   - This view summarizes total sales for each product by joining the Products and Sales tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Indexed Views**:\n",
    "   - Indexed views are stored physically in the database and can have indexes, improving query performance.\n",
    "   - Example:\n",
    "     ```sql\n",
    "     CREATE VIEW IndexedSalesSummary\n",
    "     WITH SCHEMABINDING\n",
    "     AS\n",
    "     SELECT p.ProductName, SUM(s.Quantity) AS TotalSold\n",
    "     FROM dbo.Products p\n",
    "     INNER JOIN dbo.Sales s ON p.ProductID = s.ProductID\n",
    "     GROUP BY p.ProductName;\n",
    "     \n",
    "     CREATE UNIQUE CLUSTERED INDEX IX_IndexedSalesSummary_ProductName \n",
    "     ON IndexedSalesSummary (ProductName);\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   - This view is similar to the previous example but is indexed for faster retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Materialized Views**:\n",
    "   - Materialized views store the result set of the query physically, allowing for faster access at the cost of\n",
    "     storage and maintenance overhead.\n",
    "   - Example:\n",
    "     ```sql\n",
    "     CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW MonthlySales AS\n",
    "     SELECT DATE_FORMAT(OrderDate, '%Y-%m') AS Month, SUM(TotalAmount) AS Total\n",
    "     FROM Orders\n",
    "     GROUP BY DATE_FORMAT(OrderDate, '%Y-%m');\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   - This view stores the total sales for each month, computed from the Orders table.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Recursive Views**:\n",
    "   - Recursive views are used for recursive queries, typically involving hierarchical data structures like\n",
    "     organizational charts.\n",
    "   - Example:\n",
    "     ```sql\n",
    "     CREATE VIEW EmployeeHierarchy AS\n",
    "     SELECT EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName, ManagerID\n",
    "     FROM Employees\n",
    "     WHERE ManagerID IS NULL\n",
    "     UNION ALL\n",
    "     SELECT e.EmployeeID, e.FirstName, e.LastName, e.ManagerID\n",
    "     FROM Employees e\n",
    "     INNER JOIN EmployeeHierarchy eh ON e.ManagerID = eh.EmployeeID;\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   - This view retrieves an organizational hierarchy where each employee reports to another employee, forming a\n",
    "     tree-like structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each type of view serves a distinct purpose and can be used based on the specific requirements of the database and application.\n",
    "\n",

    "Question No 2-      What is the difference between function and stored procedure? Write syntax for creating \n",
    "                    functions and stored procedures.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "Ans-\n",
    "\n",
    "      In the context of databases, functions and stored procedures are both stored blocks of SQL code that can be \n",
    "    invoked to perform specific tasks. However, they have some key differences in terms of their purpose, usage, and syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Differences between Functions and Stored Procedures:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Return Value**:\n",
    "   - Functions must return a single value.\n",
    "   - Stored procedures may or may not return values.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Usage**:\n",
    "   - Functions are typically used to compute and return scalar values or table-based results.\n",
    "   - Stored procedures are generally used to perform operations such as data manipulation, transaction control, or business\n",
    "     logic processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Transaction Control**:\n",
    "   - Functions cannot contain transaction control statements like COMMIT or ROLLBACK.\n",
    "   - Stored procedures can contain transaction control statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Scope**:\n",
    "   - Functions can be used in SQL queries, such as in the SELECT statement.\n",
    "   - Stored procedures cannot be used in SQL queries directly; they are invoked using EXECUTE or CALL statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Error Handling**:\n",
    "   - Functions can handle errors using TRY-CATCH blocks but cannot raise errors using RAISEERROR.\n",
    "   - Stored procedures can handle errors using TRY-CATCH blocks and can raise custom errors using RAISEERROR.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Syntax for Creating Functions:**\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE FUNCTION function_name (parameters)\n",
    "RETURNS return_data_type\n",
    "AS\n",
    "BEGIN\n",
    "    -- Function body\n",
    "    RETURN return_value;\n",
    "END;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE FUNCTION GetEmployeeCount ()\n",
    "RETURNS INT\n",
    "AS\n",
    "BEGIN\n",
    "    DECLARE @Count INT;\n",
    "    SELECT @Count = COUNT(*) FROM Employees;\n",
    "    RETURN @Count;\n",
    "END;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Syntax for Creating Stored Procedures:**\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE PROCEDURE procedure_name (parameters)\n",
    "AS\n",
    "BEGIN\n",
    "    -- Procedure body\n",
    "END;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE PROCEDURE UpdateEmployeeSalary @EmployeeID INT, @NewSalary DECIMAL\n",
    "AS\n",
    "BEGIN\n",
    "    UPDATE Employees\n",
    "    SET Salary = @NewSalary\n",
    "    WHERE EmployeeID = @EmployeeID;\n",
    "END;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, functions are primarily used for calculations and returning values, while stored procedures are used\n",
    "for executing a sequence of SQL statements or performing specific operations. The choice between using a function\n",
    "or a stored procedure depends on the specific requirements of the task at hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Question No 3-      What is an index in SQL? What are the different types of indexes in SQL? \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "    In SQL databases, an index is a data structure that provides quick access to rows in a table based on the values\n",
    "    of one or more columns. Indexes are used to speed up data retrieval operations, such as SELECT queries, by \n",
    "    allowing the database engine to locate rows more efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several types of indexes commonly used in SQL databases:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Single-Column Index**:\n",
    "   - A single-column index is created on a single column of a table.\n",
    "   - It speeds up queries that filter or sort data based on that column.\n",
    "   - Example:\n",
    "     ```sql\n",
    "     CREATE INDEX idx_last_name ON employees(last_name);\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Composite Index**:\n",
    "   - A composite index is created on multiple columns of a table.\n",
    "   - It can speed up queries that filter or sort data based on combinations of these columns.\n",
    "   - Example:\n",
    "     ```sql\n",
    "     CREATE INDEX idx_last_name_first_name ON employees(last_name, first_name);\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Unique Index**:\n",
    "   - A unique index ensures that all values in the indexed columns are unique.\n",
    "   - It is commonly used to enforce uniqueness constraints on columns.\n",
    "   - Example:\n",
    "     ```sql\n",
    "     CREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx_employee_id ON employees(employee_id);\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Clustered Index**:\n",
    "   - A clustered index determines the physical order of rows in a table.\n",
    "   - Each table can have only one clustered index because the rows are physically ordered by the clustered index key.\n",
    "   - Example:\n",
    "     ```sql\n",
    "     CREATE CLUSTERED INDEX idx_employee_id ON employees(employee_id);\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Non-Clustered Index**:\n",
    "   - A non-clustered index is a separate structure from the table and contains a sorted list of references to the table's rows.\n",
    "   - It does not affect the physical order of rows in the table.\n",
    "   - Example:\n",
    "     ```sql\n",
    "     CREATE NONCLUSTERED INDEX idx_last_name ON employees(last_name);\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Full-Text Index**:\n",
    "   - A full-text index is used for searching text data efficiently.\n",
    "   - It allows for advanced text searching capabilities, such as searching for words or phrases, word proximity searches, \n",
    "     and stemming.\n",
    "   - Example:\n",
    "     ```sql\n",
    "     CREATE FULLTEXT INDEX idx_description ON products(description);\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Spatial Index**:\n",
    "   - A spatial index is used for optimizing spatial queries on spatial data types, such as geometry and geography.\n",
    "   - It enables efficient searching and analysis of spatial data.\n",
    "   - Example:\n",
    "     ```sql\n",
    "     CREATE SPATIAL INDEX idx_location ON locations(geometry_column);\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "These are some of the commonly used types of indexes in SQL databases, each serving a specific purpose in optimizing \n",
    "data retrieval performance. The choice of index type depends on the nature of the data, the types of queries performed, \n",
    "and the overall database design considerations.\n",

    "        RAISERROR(@ErrorMessage, @ErrorSeverity, @ErrorState);\n",
    "    END CATCH\n",
    "END;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this stored procedure:\n",
    "\n",
    "- We first define the procedure `DivideNumbers` which takes two parameters: `@Numerator` and `@Denominator`.\n",
    "- Inside the `BEGIN TRY` block, we attempt to perform the division of `@Numerator` by `@Denominator`.\n",
    "- We first check if the `@Denominator` is zero, which would result in a division by zero error. In that case, \n",
    "  we use the `THROW` statement to raise a custom error with a specific error code, message, and state.\n",
    "- If the division is successful, we calculate the result and output it using a `SELECT` statement.\n",
    "- In the `BEGIN CATCH` block, we catch any errors that occur within the `TRY` block.\n",
    "- We retrieve the error message, severity, and state using the `ERROR_MESSAGE()`, `ERROR_SEVERITY()`, and `ERROR_STATE()\n",
    "  ` functions, respectively.\n",
    "- We log the error message, severity, and state into an `ErrorLog` table for later analysis or debugging.\n",
    "- Finally, we use the `RAISERROR` statement to re-raise the error to the caller, which will handle the error \n",
    "  appropriately based on the error message, severity, and state.\n",
    "\n",
    "This example demonstrates how to handle exceptions within a SQL Server stored procedure using the TRY-CATCH block\n",

    "\n",
    "    \n",

    "Ans-\n",
    "\n",
    "In SQL, temporary tables and table variables serve similar purposes in that they both allow you to store and manipulate\n",
    "data temporarily within a session. However, there are some differences in terms of their scope, behavior, and usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Temporary Tables:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Temporary tables are physical tables that are stored in the tempdb system database. They are useful for storing \n",
    "intermediate results or temporary data that needs to persist across multiple sessions within the same connection or session.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Syntax for Creating Temporary Tables:**\n",

    "    FirstName NVARCHAR(50),\n",
    "    LastName NVARCHAR(50)\n",
    ");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Table Variables:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Table variables are variables of type TABLE that can hold a set of records similar to a temporary table. However, \n",
    "table variables are stored in memory and exist only for the duration of the batch, procedure, or function in which\n",
    "they are declared. They are useful for smaller datasets and do not have as much overhead as temporary tables.\n",

    "```sql\n",
    "DECLARE @Employees TABLE (\n",
    "    EmployeeID INT,\n",
    "    FirstName NVARCHAR(50),\n",
    "    LastName NVARCHAR(50)\n",
    ");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Comparison:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Temporary tables are physically stored in the tempdb database and can be accessed across multiple sessions within\n",
    "the same connection, while table variables are stored in memory and have a limited scope within the batch, procedure,\n",
    "or function where they are declared.\n",
    "- Temporary tables can be indexed and used with transactions, while table variables cannot be indexed and do not\n",
    "support transactions.\n",
    "- Temporary tables have higher overhead due to disk I/O operations and logging in the tempdb database, while table\n",
    "variables have lower overhead as they are stored in memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, both temporary tables and table variables serve as temporary storage mechanisms in SQL, but the choice \n",
    "between them depends on factors such as data size, scope, and performance considerations.\n"
