    " \n",
    "    In programming, calling a function from within another function is a common practice and is referred to as\n",
    "    \"function composition\" or \"function calling.\" \n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a simple example in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def inner_function():\n",
    "    print(\"This is the inner function.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "def outer_function():\n",
    "    print(\"This is the outer function.\")\n",

    "Question 2-   How to inspect the query's execution plan?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Inspecting a query's execution plan depends on the database management system (DBMS) you are using. Different\n",
    "database systems provide different tools and methods to view the execution plan. However, here are some general \n",
    "methods that are commonly used across various database systems:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Using SQL Syntax**: Some database systems allow you to prepend your SQL query with a keyword like `EXPLAIN` \n",
    "    or `EXPLAIN PLAN` to display the query execution plan. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```sql\n",
    "    EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE condition;\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    This will show you the execution plan for the provided SQL query.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Using DBMS-specific Command-Line Tools**: Many DBMSs offer command-line tools that allow you to interact with\n",
    "    the database and view execution plans. For example:\n",
    "    - For PostgreSQL, you can use `EXPLAIN` or `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` before your query.\n",
    "    - For MySQL, you can use `EXPLAIN` before your query.\n",
    "    - For Microsoft SQL Server, you can use `SET SHOWPLAN_TEXT ON` before your query.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Using Graphical User Interface (GUI) Tools**: Many database management tools come with graphical interfaces\n",
    "    that allow you to view query execution plans visually. For example:\n",
    "    - PgAdmin for PostgreSQL\n",
    "    - MySQL Workbench for MySQL\n",
    "    - SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) for Microsoft SQL Server\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Using Profiling and Monitoring Tools**: Some DBMSs come with built-in or third-party profiling and monitoring\n",
    "    tools that can provide detailed insights into query execution plans and performance metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Using ORM Tools**: If you're using an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) framework like SQLAlchemy in Python,\n",
    "    many of these frameworks provide methods to inspect and log the generated SQL queries along with their execution plans.\n",
    "\n",
    "When inspecting query execution plans, you're looking for information such as the order in which tables are accessed,\n",
    "the indexes used, join methods, and other optimization details. This information helps in understanding how the\n",
    "database system is processing your queries and can be used to optimize query performance if needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Question 3-   What is the purpose of the MAXDOP and recompiling keywords in SQL queries?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In SQL Server, MAXDOP (Maximum Degree of Parallelism) and recompiling keywords are used to control query execution\n",
    "behavior and optimize query performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **MAXDOP (Maximum Degree of Parallelism)**:\n",
    "   - The MAXDOP setting controls the maximum number of processors that can be used in parallel to execute a single query.\n",
    "   - Setting MAXDOP too high can lead to resource contention and degradation of overall server performance,\n",
    "    while setting it too low might result in underutilization of resources.\n",
    "   - By adjusting MAXDOP, you can optimize query execution for specific workloads and server configurations.\n",
    "   - It's important to carefully evaluate and tune MAXDOP based on the workload and available hardware resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example usage:\n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   OPTION (MAXDOP 4)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Recompiling Keywords**:\n",
    "   - SQL Server allows you to specify the `RECOMPILE` option for a query, which forces SQL Server to generate a\n",
    "     new execution plan each time the query is executed.\n",
    "   - This can be useful when the query parameters vary significantly between executions, leading to suboptimal execution plans.\n",
    "   - Recompiling the query allows SQL Server to adapt the execution plan based on the current parameter values,\n",
    "    potentially improving performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example usage:\n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   OPTION (RECOMPILE)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, MAXDOP is used to control the degree of parallelism for query execution, while the RECOMPILE keyword is\n",
    "used to force SQL Server to recompile the query and generate a new execution plan dynamically. Both options are\n",
    "important for optimizing query performance in SQL Server environments.\n",

    "Question 4-   How to build DDL statements from an existing database table, write steps for it?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To build Data Definition Language (DDL) statements from an existing database table, you typically need to extract\n",
    "the structure of the table including its columns, data types, constraints, and indexes. Below are the general steps\n",
    "to accomplish this:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Identify the Database and Table**:\n",
    "   - Determine the database system (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server) where the table exists.\n",
    "   - Identify the name of the database containing the table.\n",
    "   - Identify the name of the table for which you want to generate DDL statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Connect to the Database**:\n",
    "   - Use a database management tool or command-line interface to connect to the database where the table resides.\n",
    "   - Ensure you have the necessary permissions to access the table structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Retrieve Table Structure**:\n",
    "   - Use appropriate SQL commands or built-in functions provided by your database system to retrieve the structure \n",
    "of the table.\n",
    "   - Common SQL commands for this purpose include `DESCRIBE`, `SHOW CREATE TABLE`, or querying system catalogs/tables\n",
    "    like `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` (for MySQL) or `sys.tables` (for SQL Server).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Analyze the Structure**:\n",
    "   - Review the retrieved information to understand the table structure.\n",
    "   - Note the column names, data types, constraints (such as primary key, foreign key, unique constraint), and indexes \n",
    "    defined on the table.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Generate DDL Statements**:\n",
    "   - Based on the retrieved table structure, manually write or programmatically generate DDL statements to recreate the table.\n",
    "   - Construct DDL statements for creating the table, adding columns, defining constraints, and creating indexes.\n",
    "   - Pay attention to details such as data types, lengths, and constraints to ensure accuracy in the generated DDL statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Validate DDL Statements**:\n",
    "   - Before executing the DDL statements, validate them to ensure correctness and completeness.\n",
    "   - Verify that the generated DDL statements accurately represent the structure of the existing table.\n",
    "   - Check for any potential errors or inconsistencies in the DDL statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Execute DDL Statements**:\n",
    "   - Once validated, execute the generated DDL statements against the database to create a new table with the same \n",
    "     structure as the existing table.\n",
    "   - Ensure that you have the necessary permissions to execute DDL statements on the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "By following these steps, you can build DDL statements from an existing database table, which can be used to recreate \n",
    "the table structure in another database or for version control purposes.\n",

    "Question 5-   How to update data in a table using an inner join, write an example?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To update data in a table using an inner join in SQL, you can use the `UPDATE` statement along with the `INNER JOIN` \n",
    "clause to specify the join condition between two or more tables. Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say we have two tables: `employees` and `departments`. We want to update the `department_id` of employees based\n",
    "on a condition that matches their `department_name` from the `departments` table.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "-- Example tables: employees and departments\n",
    "CREATE TABLE departments (\n",
    "    department_id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "    department_name VARCHAR(50)\n",
    ");\n",
    "\n",
    "CREATE TABLE employees (\n",
    "    employee_id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "    employee_name VARCHAR(50),\n",
    "    department_id INT,\n",
    "    FOREIGN KEY (department_id) REFERENCES departments(department_id)\n",
    ");\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Sample data in departments table\n",
    "INSERT INTO departments (department_id, department_name) VALUES\n",
    "(1, 'Engineering'),\n",
    "(2, 'Marketing'),\n",
    "(3, 'Sales');\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Sample data in employees table\n",
    "INSERT INTO employees (employee_id, employee_name, department_id) VALUES\n",
    "(101, 'John Doe', 1),\n",
    "(102, 'Jane Smith', 2),\n",
    "(103, 'Mike Johnson', 3);\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Update data in employees table using inner join\n",
    "UPDATE employees\n",
    "INNER JOIN departments ON employees.department_id = departments.department_id\n",
    "SET employees.department_id = departments.department_id\n",
    "WHERE departments.department_name = 'Engineering';\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we're updating the `department_id` of employees to match the `department_id` from the `departments`\n",
    "table where the `department_name` is 'Engineering'. The `INNER JOIN` clause ensures that only rows from the `employees` \n",
    "table that satisfy the join condition with the `departments` table are updated.\n",
    "\n",
    "After executing this SQL statement, the `department_id` of employees in the 'Engineering' department will be updated\n",
    "accordingly based on the `department_id` from the `departments` table.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Truncate, Delete, and Drop are SQL commands used for data manipulation and database schema management. \n",
    "Here's how they differ along with suitable examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **TRUNCATE**:\n",
    "   - `TRUNCATE` is used to remove all rows from a table, effectively deleting all data while keeping the table\n",
    "     structure intact.\n",
    "   - It is faster than `DELETE` as it does not generate individual delete operations for each row. Instead,\n",
    "     it deallocates data pages in bulk.\n",
    "   - It resets identity columns to their seed value (starting value).\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   TRUNCATE TABLE table_name;\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **DELETE**:\n",
    "   - `DELETE` is used to remove one or more rows from a table based on specified conditions.\n",
    "   - It is slower than `TRUNCATE` because it generates individual delete operations for each row, which can lead \n",
    "    to higher transaction log activity.\n",
    "   - It can be used with a `WHERE` clause to delete specific rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition;\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **DROP**:\n",
    "   - `DROP` is used to remove database objects such as tables, views, indexes, or even entire databases.\n",
    "   - It removes both the structure and data associated with the object, effectively deleting it from the database.\n",
    "   - It is irreversible and requires careful consideration as it permanently removes the object and its data.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   DROP TABLE table_name;\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Note**: Dropping a table using `DROP` command removes both the table structure and its data, whereas using\n",
    "        `TRUNCATE` command removes only the data while keeping the table structure intact. `DELETE` command, on the\n",
    "        other hand, removes specific rows from the table based on the conditions specified in the `WHERE` clause.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example usage scenarios:\n",
    "- Use `TRUNCATE` when you want to quickly remove all data from a table and reset identity columns.\n",
    "- Use `DELETE` when you need to remove specific rows from a table based on certain conditions while keeping the table \n",
    "  structure intact.\n",
    "- Use `DROP` when you want to remove an entire table, view, or other database objects permanently from the database."
