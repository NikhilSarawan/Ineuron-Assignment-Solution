    "##1. What is the name of the feature responsible for generating Regex objects?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-.The feature responsible for generating Regex objects is the re module in Python. The re module provides a set of functions,\n",
    "    and methods for working with regular expressions, including the re.compile() function, which generates a Regex object.Here,\n",
    "    is an example of using re.compile() to create a Regex object:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    import re\n",
    "\n",
    "    pattern = re.compile(r'\\d{3}-\\d{3}-\\d{4}')\n",
    "    \n",
    "    In this example, re.compile() is used to create a Regex object that matches a phone number in the format of xxx-xxx-xxxx. \n",
    "    The r before the pattern string indicates that it should be treated as a raw string, allowing backslashes to be interpreted,\n",
    "    as literal backslashes.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Once you have a Regex object, you can use its methods to search for matches in strings, extract matching substrings,\n",
    "    and more. The re module is a powerful tool for working with text data in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "##2. Why do raw strings often appear in Regex objects?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-.Raw strings often appear in Regex objects because they allow backslashes to be treated as literal backslashes instead of \n",
    "    escape characters. Since regular expressions often contain a lot of backslashes, it can be cumbersome to escape them all\n",
    "    manually. Using a raw string makes it easier to write and read regular expressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Here's an example to illustrate the point. Let is say we want to match a backslash followed by a digit:\n",
    "        import re\n",
    "\n",
    "        Using a regular string\n",
    "        pattern1 = re.compile(\"\\\\\\d\")\n",
    "\n",
    "        Using a raw string\n",
    "        pattern2 = re.compile(r\"\\\\d\")\n",
    "        \n",
    "        \n",
    "    In pattern1, we need to use two backslashes to match a single backslash because the first backslash is an escape character\n",
    "    that must be escaped itself. In pattern2, we use a raw string and only need to use a single backslash to match a backslash \n",
    "    followed by a digit.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Using raw strings in regular expressions can make them more readable and less error-prone, especially when dealing\n",
    "    with complex patterns that contain many backslashes.\n",
    "\n",
    "##3. What is the return value of the search() method?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-.The search() method is a method of a compiled Regex object in Python's re module. It searches the given input string for \n",
    "    the first occurrence of the regular expression pattern, and returns a Match object if a match is found, otherwise it\n",
    "    returns None.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The Match object contains information about the matched substring, including the starting and ending indices of the match,\n",
    "    as well as the matched substring itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Here's an example of using the search() method:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    import re\n",
    "\n",
    "    pattern = re.compile(r'\\d+')\n",
    "    match = pattern.search('I have 2 cats and 3 dogs.')\n",
    "\n",
    "    if match:\n",
    "    print('Match found:', match.group())\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "    print('No match found.')\n",
    "\n",
    "    in this example, the regular expression \\d+ matches one or more digits. The search() method is used to search the input\n",
    "    string 'I have 2 cats and 3 dogs.' for the first occurrence of the pattern. Since there are digits in the input string,\n",
    "    the method returns a Match object.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The if match: statement checks if a match was found, and if so, the group() method is called on the Match object to get\n",
    "    the matched substring. In this case, it prints 'Match found: 2'.\n",
    "\n",
    "    If the pattern is not found in the input string, the search() method returns None, indicating that no match was found.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Note that the search() method only finds the first match in the input string. If you want to find all matches, \n",
    "    you can use the findall() method instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "##4. From a Match item, how do you get the actual strings that match the pattern?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-.Once you have obtained a Match object using the search() method of a compiled regular expression, you can use the group()\n",
    "    method to get the actual string that matched the pattern.The group() method returns the entire match by default,\n",
    "    but you can also specify a group number to get a specific group. Groups are defined using parentheses in the regular,\n",
    "    expression pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Here's an example:\n",
    "    import re\n",
    "\n",
    "    pattern = re.compile(r'(\\d{3})-(\\d{3}-\\d{4})')\n",
    "    match = pattern.search('My phone number is 123-456-7890.')\n",
    "\n",
    "    if match:\n",
    "    print('Full match:', match.group())         # '123-456-7890'\n",
    "    print('Area code:', match.group(1))         # '123'\n",
    "    print('Phone number:', match.group(2))      # '456-7890'\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "    print('No match found.')\n",
    "    \n",
    "    In this example, the regular expression pattern \\d{3}-\\d{3}-\\d{4} matches a phone number in the format of '###-###-####'. The pattern is grouped using parentheses to define two groups - the area code and the phone number.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The search() method is used to search the input string 'My phone number is 123-456-7890.' for the phone number pattern.\n",
    "    Since there is a phone number in the input string, the method returns a Match object.The if match: statement checks if a,\n",
    "    match was found, and if so, the group() method is called on the Match object to get the entire matched substring.\n",
    "    In this case, it prints 'Full match: 123-456-7890'.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The group(1) method is called on the Match object to get the area code (the first group defined by the parentheses in the,\n",
    "    pattern). In this case, it prints 'Area code: 123'.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The group(2) method is called on the Match object to get the phone number (the second group defined by the parentheses in,\n",
    "    the pattern). In this case, it prints 'Phone number: 456-7890'.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Note that if there are no groups defined in the regular expression pattern, you can still use the group(),\n",
    "    method to get the entire matched substring. In that case, calling group(0) is equivalent to calling group().\n",

    "##5. In the regex which created from the r'(\\d\\d\\d)-(\\d\\d\\d-\\d\\d\\d\\d)', what does group zero cover? Group 2? Group 1?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-.The regular expression r'(\\d\\d\\d)-(\\d\\d\\d-\\d\\d\\d\\d)' defines two groups using parentheses.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Group 1: (\\d\\d\\d) matches three consecutive digits before a hyphen.\n",

    "     #,it to fit real parentheses and periods?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-.The findall() method in Python re module returns either a list of strings or a list of tuples depending on whether the ,\n",
    "    regular expression pattern contains capturing groups or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "    If the pattern contains no capturing groups, then findall() returns a list of strings representing all non-overlapping \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##7. The findall() method returns a string list or a list of string tuples. What causes it to return one of the two options?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-The findall() method in Pythons re module returns either a list of strings or a list of tuples depending on whether the \n",

    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##8. In standard expressions, what does the | character mean?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-..In standard regular expressions, the | character is known as the alternation or OR operator.\n",
    "    It allows you to match either one pattern or another pattern.For example, the regular expression cat|dog,\n",
    "    matches either the string \"cat\" or the string \"dog\". If the input string contains both \"cat\" and \"dog\", \n",
    "    the regex will match the first occurrence of either one.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Here's an example Python code that uses the | operator to match either \"cat\" or \"dog\":\n",
    "    \n",
    "    import re\n",
    "\n",
    "    input_str = \"I have a cat and a dog\"\n",
    "    pattern = r\"cat|dog\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    matches = re.findall(pattern, input_str)\n",
    "    print(matches) # Output: ['cat', 'dog']\n",
    "    In this example, the findall() method returns a list of all matches found in the input string. \n",
    "    Since the input string contains both \"cat\" and \"dog\", the resulting list contains both strings in the order they were found.\n",
    "\n",
    "##9. In regular expressions, what does the character stand for?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-.In regular expressions, the . character (period or dot) is known as the dot metacharacter, which matches any single\n",
    "    character except a newline.For example, the regular expression a.b matches any three-character string that starts with \"a\",\n",
    "    ends with \"b\", and has any single character in between \"a\" and \"b\". So it would match \"acb\", \"aab\", \"a1b\", \"a b\", and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Here's an example Python code that uses the . metacharacter to match a three-letter word that starts with \"a\" and ends,\n",
    "    with \"t\":\n",
    "\n",
    "    import re\n",
    "\n",
    "    input_str = \"I have a cat and a hat, but not a bat or a mat\"\n",
    "    pattern = r\"a.t\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    matches = re.findall(pattern, input_str)\n",
    "    print(matches) # Output: ['cat', 'hat']\n",
    "    \n",
    "    In this example, the findall() method returns a list of all matches found in the input string. The .\n",
    "    metacharacter matches any single character in between \"a\" and \"t\".\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##10.In regular expressions, what is the difference between the + and * characters?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-.In regular expressions, the + and * characters are used to specify the number of occurrences of the preceding\n",
    "    character or group.The + character matches one or more occurrences of the preceding character or group. \n",
    "    For example, the regular expression \"ab+\" matches the string \"ab\" followed by one or more occurrences of the letter \"b\",\n",
    "    such as \"abb\", \"abbb\", \"abbbb\", and so on.The * character matches zero or more occurrences of the preceding character or\n",
    "    group. For example, the regular expression \"ab*\" matches the string \"a\" followed by zero or more occurrences of the letter\n",
    "    \"b\", such as \"a\", \"ab\", \"abb\", \"abbb\", and so on. So, the main difference is that + requires at least one occurrence of the\n",
    "    preceding character or group, while * does not require any occurrence.\n",
    "\n",
    "##11. What is the difference between {4} and {4,5} in regular expression?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-.In regular expressions, the symbols {} are used to indicate the number of times a pattern should be repeated.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The notation {4} means that the preceding pattern should be repeated exactly four times. For example, \n",
    "    the regular expression \"a{4}\" matches the string \"aaaa\", but not \"aa\" or \"aaaaa\".\n",
    "\n",
    "    On the other hand, the notation {4,5} means that the preceding pattern should be repeated at least four times,\n",
    "    but no more than five times. For example, the regular expression \"a{4,5}\" matches the strings \"aaaa\" and \"aaaaa\",\n",
    "    but not \"aa\" or \"aaaaaa\".\n",
    "\n",
    "    So the main difference between {4} and {4,5} is that {4} requires the pattern to be repeated exactly four times, \n",
    "    while {4,5} allows it to be repeated four or five times.\n",
    "\n",
    "    For example, the regular expression \"x{4}\" would match \"xxxx\" but not \"xxx\" or \"xxxxx\", \n",
    "    while the regular expression \"y{4,5}\" would match \"yyyy\" and \"yyyyy\" but not \"yyy\" or \"yyyyyy\".\n",
    "\n",
    "##12. What do you mean by the \\d, \\w, and \\s shorthand character classes signify in regular expressions?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-.In regular expressions, shorthand character classes are special symbols that represent certain sets of characters. These shorthand character classes can be used to match patterns that are commonly found in text data.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The following are the most common shorthand character classes:\n",
    "\n",
    "    \\d - Matches any digit character. This is equivalent to the character class [0-9]. For example, \n",
    "    the regular expression \\d+ matches one or more digits. So, it would match \"123\" or \"4567\", but not \"abc\".\n",
    "\n",
    "    \\w - Matches any word character, which includes letters, digits, and underscores. \n",
    "    This is equivalent to the character class [a-zA-Z0-9_]. For example, the regular expression \\w+ matches one or more word \n",
    "    characters. So, it would match \"hello\", \"world_123\", but not \"hello!\".\n",
    "\n",
    "    \\s - Matches any whitespace character, such as a space, tab, or newline.\n",
    "    This is equivalent to the character class [ \\t\\n\\r\\f\\v]. For example, the regular expression \\s+ matches one or more whitespace characters. So, it would match \" \", \" \\t\\r\\n\", but not \"hello\".\n",
    "\n",
    "    Here are some examples of using shorthand character classes:\n",
    "\n",
    "    The regular expression \\d{3}-\\d{2}-\\d{4} matches a Social Security Number (SSN) in the format of \"123-45-6789\".\n",
    "    The regular expression \\w+@\\w+\\.\\w{2,3} matches an email address in the format of \"example123@example.com\".\n",
    "    The regular expression (\\s?\\d{3}){3}\\s? matches a phone number in the format of \"123 456 7890\" or \"1234567890\".\n",
    "\n",
    "##13. What do means by \\D, \\W, and \\S shorthand character classes signify in regular expressions?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-.In regular expressions, shorthand character classes are used to represent certain groups of characters. \n",
    "    These shorthand character classes make it easier to match specific types of characters in a given string.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Here are the explanations and examples of the \\D, \\W, and \\S shorthand character classes:\n",
    "\n",
    "    \\D: This shorthand character class represents any non-digit character. It is equivalent to [^0-9]. \n",
    "        For example, the regular expression \"a\\Dc\" will match any string that starts with \"a\", \n",
    "        followed by any non-digit character, and ends with \"c\". So, it will match \"abc\", \"a#c\", but not \"a5c\".\n",
    "\n",
    "    \\W: This shorthand character class represents any non-word character. It is equivalent to [^a-zA-Z0-9_]. For example, \n",
    "        the regular expression \"\\W+\" will match any sequence of one or more non-word characters. So, it will match \"!!\", \"**\",\n",
    "        but not \"hello_world\".\n",
    "\n",
    "    \\S: This shorthand character class represents any non-whitespace character. It is equivalent to [^\\s]. For example,\n",
    "        the regular expression \"\\S+\" will match any sequence of one or more non-whitespace characters. So,\n",
    "        it will match \"hello\", \"world\", but not \"hello world\".\n",
    "\n",
    "    Overall, shorthand character classes are a powerful tool in regular expressions that allow you to match specific types \n",
    "    of characters quickly and easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##14. What is the difference between .*? and .*?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-.There seems to be a typo in your question. I'll provide an explanation of the difference between .* and .*? instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "    In regular expressions, .* is a greedy quantifier that matches zero or more of any character, including newline characters,\n",
    "    abs as many times as possible. This means that it will match as much of the string as it possibly can.\n",
    "\n",
    "    For example, the regular expression a.*c applied to the string abbbcabc will match the entire string abbbcabc because the .\n",
    "    * matches \"bbb\".\n",
    "\n",
    "    On the other hand, .*? is a lazy quantifier that matches zero or more of any character, including newline characters,\n",
    "    as few times as possible. This means that it will match as little of the string as it possibly can.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    For example, the regular expression a.*?c applied to the string abbbcabc will only match abc, because the .*?\n",
    "    matches \"nothing\" between the a and the b, and then matches the smallest possible sequence of characters until it reaches\n",
    "    the c.\n",
    "\n",
    "    So, the main difference between .* and .*? is that .* is greedy and matches as much as possible, while .*? is lazy\n",
    "    and matches as little as possible.\n",

    "##15. What is the syntax for matching both numbers and lowercase letters with a character class?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-.To match both numbers and lowercase letters in a regular expression, you can use a character class,\n",
    "    which is enclosed in square brackets [ ] and contains a list of characters to match.\n",
    "    Here the syntax to match both numbers and lowercase letters using a character class:[0-9a-z]\n",
    "    This character class matches any character that is either a number (0-9) or a lowercase letter (a-z). \n",
    "    The hyphen - indicates a range of characters, so [0-9a-z] is equivalent to writing [0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz].\n",
    "\n",
    "    Here are some examples of how to use this character class in regular expressions:\n",
    "\n",
    "    The regular expression ^[0-9a-z]+$ matches a string that contains only numbers and lowercase letters,\n",
    "    with no spaces or other characters. For example, it would match \"abc123\", but not \"ABC123\" or \"abc 123\".\n",
    "\n",
    "    The regular expression [0-9a-z]+@[a-z]+\\.[a-z]+ matches an email address that contains only lowercase letters and\n",
    "    numbers in the username and lowercase letters in the domain. For example, it would match \"john@example.com\",\n",
    "    but not \"JohnDoe@example.com\" or \"john.doe@example.com\".\n",
    "\n",
    "    Overall, using a character class is a powerful tool in regular expressions that allows you to match a specific\n",
    "    set of characters quickly and easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "##16. What is the procedure for making a normal expression in regax case insensitive?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-.To make a regular expression case insensitive, you can use a flag or modifier that is supported by most programming,\n",
    "    languages and regular expression engines. Here are the general steps to make a regular expression case insensitive:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Identify the regular expression pattern that you want to make case insensitive.\n",
    "    This could be any pattern that contains letters or words that can be matched regardless of their case.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Add the case-insensitive flag to the regular expression. The specific syntax for adding the flag may vary depending,\n",
    "    on the programming language or regular expression engine that you are using. In most cases,\n",
    "    you can add the flag as a modifier after the closing delimiter of the regular expression.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Test the modified regular expression to make sure it matches the desired strings regardless of case. \n",
    "    You can use a variety of test strings with different cases to check that the regular expression is functioning correctly.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Python: You can add the re.IGNORECASE flag as a second argument when compiling the regular expression with the re.compile()\n",
    "    function.For example, the regular expression re.compile('hello', re.IGNORECASE) will match \"Hello\", \"HELLO\",\n",
    "    and \"hello\" equally.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##17. What does the . character normally match? What does it match if re.DOTALL is passed as 2nd argument in re.compile()?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-.In a regular expression, the . (dot) character normally matches any single character except for a newline character (\\n).\n",
    "    For example, the regular expression a.b would match \"acb\", \"a#b\", \"a b\", and so on, as long as there is a single character\n",
    "    between the \"a\" and the \"b\".\n",
    "\n",
    "    If the re.DOTALL flag is passed as the second argument to re.compile(), then the dot character . matches any character\n",
    "    including the newline character \\n. This means that the regular expression a.b with the re.DOTALL flag would match \"a\\nb\" as\n",
    "    well as any other string that has \"a\" followed by any character, followed by \"b\", even if the character is a newline.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Here's an example in Python to illustrate the difference. Let's say we have a string with multiple lines:\n",
    "         text = \"hello\\nworld\\n\"\n",
    "    We can use the regular expression h.llo to match \"hello\" in the string, but it won't match \"hel\\nlo\" because the\n",
    "    newline character \\n is between \"el\" and \"lo\". However,if we use the re.DOTALL flag with the regular expression, like this:\n",
    "        import re\n",
    "\n",
    "    pattern = re.compile('h.llo', re.DOTALL)\n",
    "    match = pattern.search(text)\n",
    "    Now the dot character . matches any character, including the newline character \\n,\n",
    "    so the regular expression will match \"hel\\nlo\" as well as \"hello\".\n",
    "\n",
    "    Overall, the re.DOTALL flag can be useful when you want to match a pattern that includes newline characters,\n",
    "    such as when you're working with multiline text.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "##18. If numReg = re.compile(r'\\d+'), what will numRegex.sub('X', '11 drummers, 10 pipers, five rings, 4 hen') return?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-.If numRegex = re.compile(r'\\d+'), then numRegex.sub('X', '11 drummers, 10 pipers, five rings, 4 hen') will return the string:\n",
    "    'X drummers, X pipers, five rings, X hen'\n",
    "    Here's how the regular expression substitution works:\n",
    "\n",
    "    The regular expression \\d+ matches one or more digits in the input string.\n",
    "    The sub() method replaces each match of the regular expression with the string 'X'.\n",
    "    In the input string '11 drummers, 10 pipers, five rings, 4 hen', the regular expression matches the substrings '11', '10',\n",
    "    and '4'.Each match of the regular expression is replaced with the string 'X', resulting in the new string 'X drummers,\n",
    "    X pipers, five rings, X hen'.So the final result is a new string where all the digit sequences have been replaced with,\n",
    "    the letter 'X'.\n",
    "\n",
    "##19. What does passing re.VERBOSE as the 2nd argument to re.compile() allow to do?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-.Passing re.VERBOSE as the second argument to re.compile() in Python allows you to create a regular expression pattern\n",
    "    with whitespace and comments, without affecting the matching behavior of the pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Normally, whitespace characters (spaces, tabs, and newlines) in a regular expression pattern are significant and can affect \n",
    "    the matching behavior. This can make it difficult to write and read complex regular expressions with many parts.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The re.VERBOSE flag allows you to use whitespace and comments in the regular expression pattern to improve its readability,\n",
    "    without affecting the way the pattern matches. Here's an example:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    import re\n",
    "\n",
    "    pattern = re.compile(r\"\"\"\n",
    "    \\d+         # match one or more digits\n",
    "    [ ]?        # optionally match a space\n",
    "    (inches|cm) # match either 'inches' or 'cm'\n",
    "    \"\"\", re.VERBOSE)\n",
    "\n",
    "    match = pattern.search('The box is 10 cm wide')\n",
    "    print(match.group(0))  # output: '10 cm'\n",
    "    \n",
    "    In this example, the regular expression pattern matches a number followed by either \"inches\" or \"cm\", \n",
    "    optionally separated by a space. The re.VERBOSE flag allows us to use comments and whitespace to make the\n",
    "    pattern more readable.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Without the re.VERBOSE flag, the pattern would have to be written without whitespace and comments, like this:\n",
    "    pattern = re.compile(r'\\d+[ ]?(inches|cm)')\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Using the re.VERBOSE flag can make it easier to write and read complex regular expressions,\n",
    "    especially when they have many parts or require complicated logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "##20. How would you write a regex that match a number with comma for every three digits? It must match the given following:\n",
    "    #'42'\n",
    "    #'1,234'\n",
    "    #'6,368,745'\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-.You can use the following regular expression to match a number with commas for every three digits\n",
    "    ^\\d{1,3}(,\\d{3})*$\n",
    "    This regular expression matches a string that starts with 1-3 digits (\\d{1,3}), \n",
    "    followed by zero or more occurrences of a comma and three digits ((,\\d{3})*).\n",
    "    The ^ and $ anchors at the beginning and end of the pattern ensure that the entire string matches the pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Here's how you can use this regular expression in Python to match the examples you provided:\n",
    "    import re\n",
    "\n",
    "    pattern = re.compile(r'^\\d{1,3}(,\\d{3})*$')\n",
    "\n",
    "    match1 = pattern.match('42')\n",
    "    match2 = pattern.match('1,234')\n",
    "    match3 = pattern.match('6,368,745')\n",
    "\n",
    "    print(bool(match1))  # True\n",
    "    print(bool(match2))  # True\n",
    "    print(bool(match3))  # True\n",
    "    \n",
    "    import re\n",
    "\n",
    "    pattern = re.compile(r'^\\d{1,3}(,\\d{3})*$')\n",
    "\n",
    "    match1 = pattern.match('42')\n",
    "    match2 = pattern.match('1,234')\n",
    "    match3 = pattern.match('6,368,745')\n",
    "\n",
    "    print(bool(match1))  # True\n",
    "    print(bool(match2))  # True\n",
    "    print(bool(match3))  # True\n",
    "\n",
    "    All three examples match the regular expression pattern and return True.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Note that this regular expression only matches numbers with commas every three digits.\n",
    "    It does not allow for decimal places or negative numbers. If you need to match numbers with decimal,\n",
    "    places or negative numbers,you may need to modify the regular expression pattern accordingly.\n",
