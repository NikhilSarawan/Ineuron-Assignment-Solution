    "##1. Create an assert statement that throws an AssertionError if the variable spam is a negative integer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-.Here is an example of an assert statement that throws an AssertionError if the variable spam is a negative integer:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    assert spam >= 0, \"spam must be a non-negative integer\"\n",
    "    \n",
    "    In this statement, we're checking that spam is greater than or equal to zero.\n",
    "    If it is not, an AssertionError will be raised with the message \"spam must be a non-negative integer\".\n",
    "    This is a way to catch programming errors early on, so that we can identify and fix them quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "##2. Write an assert statement that triggers an AssertionError if the variables eggs and bacon contain strings that are the,\n",
    "    #same as each other, even if their cases are different (that is, 'hello' and 'hello' are considered the same, and 'goodbye',\n",
    "    #and 'GOODbye' are also considered the same).\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-.Here is an example of an assert statement that triggers an AssertionError if the variables eggs and bacon contain strings,\n",
    "    that are the same as each other, even if their cases are different\n",
    "    \n",
    "    assert eggs.lower() != bacon.lower(), \"eggs and bacon cannot have the same value (ignoring case)\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    In this statement, we're using the lower() method to convert both eggs and bacon to lowercase before comparing them.\n",
    "    If the lowercase versions of eggs and bacon are the same, an AssertionError will be raised with the message,\n",
    "    \"eggs and bacon cannot have the same value (ignoring case)\".This helps to ensure that the values of eggs and bacon,\n",
    "    are truly different, regardless of their case.\n",
    "\n",
    "##3. Create an assert statement that throws an AssertionError every time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-.Here's an example of an assert statement that throws an AssertionError every time:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    assert False, \"This assert statement always raises an AssertionError\"\n",
    "    \n",
    "    In this statement, we are passing False as the first argument, which means that the assertion will always fail and raise,\n",
    "    an AssertionError. We have also included a custom message that will be displayed with the error. This can be useful for,\n",
    "    testing and debugging, since it can help us identify where the code is failing.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##4. What are the two lines that must be present in your software in order to call logging.debug()?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-.In order to call logging.debug() in your software, you must first import the logging module and configure it to display,\n",
    "    debug messages. This typically involves adding two lines to your code:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    import logging\n",
    "    logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)\n",
    "\n",
    "    The first line imports the logging module, which provides the debug() method (as well as other logging methods like info(),\n",
    "    warning(), and error()).The second line configures the logging module to display debug messages (and messages at higher,\n",
    "    severity levels, such as info, warning, and error). This is done by calling basicConfig() with the level parameter set to ,\n",
    "    logging.DEBUG. This means that messages at the DEBUG level and higher will be displayed in the console or log file ,\n",
    "    (depending on how yo HAve configured logging). With these two lines in place, you can call logging.debug() ,\n",
    "    (or any other logging method) to log debug messages in your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "##5. What are the two lines that your program must have in order to have logging.debug() send a logging message to a file named,\n",
    "    #programLog.txt?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-In order to have logging.debug() send a logging message to a file named \"programLog.txt\", you need to configure the\n",
    "    logging module to write messages to a file, in addition to displaying them in the console. This typically involves ,\n",
    "    adding the following two lines to your code:\n",
    "    import logging\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Configure logging to write messages to a file\n",
    "    logging.basicConfig(filename='programLog.txt', level=logging.DEBUG)\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Now you can call logging.debug() to log messages to the file\n",
    "    logging.debug('This is a debug message')\n",
    "    \n",
    "    The first line imports the logging module, as usual. The second line configures the logging module to write messages,\n",
    "    to a file named \"programLog.txt\", with the level parameter set to logging.DEBUG. This means that messages at the DEBUG,\n",
    "    level and higher will be written to the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Now, when you call logging.debug(), the message will be logged to both the console and the \"programLog.txt\" file.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##6.What are the five levels of logging?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-.The logging module in Python supports five levels of logging, in increasing order of severity:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1.DEBUG: Detailed information for debugging purposes.\n",
    "    2.INFO: General information about the program's execution.\n",
    "    3.WARNING: An indication that something unexpected or suspicious has happened, or indicative of some problem that may need,\n",
    "               attention.\n",
    "    4.ERROR: An indication that an error has occurred, which is serious enough to warrant attention but not so serious that the,\n",
    "             program can't continue running.\n",
    "    5.CRITICAL: A very serious error, indicating that the program may not be able to continue running.\n",
    "   \n",
    "    These levels provide a way to filter and prioritize log messages based on their severity. By default,\n",
    "    the logging module will display messages at the WARNING level and higher,but this can be customized with the basicConfig()\n",
    "    method, as described in earlier questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "##7. What line of code would you add to your software to disable all logging messages?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-.In order to disable all logging messages in your software, you can add the following line of code:\n",
    "    logging.disable(logging.CRITICAL)\n",
    "    This line of code disables all logging messages at and below the CRITICAL level (which is the highest level of severity).\n",
    "    This means that no log messages will be displayed in the console or written to log files, regardless of their severity level.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Note that this line of code should be used with caution, as it effectively silences all logging messages. \n",
    "    It should only be used in specific circumstances, such as when you want to suppress all logging output for a particular,\n",
    "    section of code or when,debugging is complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "##8.Why is using logging messages better than using print() to display the same message?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-.Using logging messages is better than using print() statements for displaying the same message for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1.Flexibility and configurability: The logging module provides a lot of flexibility and configurability options.\n",
    "    You can control the format of the messages, the level of severity, the output destination (e.g., console or file), and more.\n",
    "    This makes it easier to manage and customize your logging output to suit your needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    2.Granularity and control: With logging messages, you can control the level of detail that is output to the console or log,\n",
    "    file. This allows you to separate critical messages from informational or debugging messages, which makes it easier to,\n",
    "    identify and troubleshoot issues. In contrast, print() statements are typically all-or-nothing: either you see the message ,\n",
    "    or you don't.\n",
    "\n",
    "    3.Performance impact: When you use print() statements for debugging, you may forget to remove them when you're done.\n",
    "    This can lead to a lot of unnecessary output that slows down your program. In contrast, logging messages can be enabled,\n",
    "    or disabled easily, which allows you to control when and where the messages are displayed. This can help you avoid,\n",
    "    unnecessary performance impacts.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    4.Thread-safety: The logging module is thread-safe, which means that you can use it in multithreaded programs without ,\n",
    "    worrying about race conditions or other concurrency issues. This is not the case with print() statements, \n",
    "    which can cause issues when used in concurrent programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Overall, using logging messages is a more powerful and flexible way to manage and customize your program's output, \n",
    "    and it provides more control over the behavior of your program.\n",
    "\n",
    "##9. What are the differences between the Step Over, Step In, and Step Out buttons in the debugger?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-.The Step Over, Step In, and Step Out buttons in the debugger are used to control the execution of the program and inspect,\n",
    "    the state of the code. Here are the differences between these buttons:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1.Step Over: The Step Over button allows you to execute the current line of code and move to the next line, without,\n",
    "    stepping into any function calls. This is useful when you want to quickly skip over a function call or other code ,\n",
    "    that you don't need to inspect in detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "    2.Step In: The Step In button allows you to execute the current line of code and step into any function calls that,\n",
    "    made on that line. This is useful when you want to inspect the inner workings of a function or method, or ,\n",
    "    when you suspect that an issue may be occurring within a function call.\n",
    "\n",
    "    3.Step Out: The Step Out button allows you to execute the remaining lines of the current function and return to the,\n",
    "    calling code, without stepping through each line individually. This is useful when you have stepped into a function,\n",
    "    and want to quickly return to the calling code without inspecting each line in detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "    In summary, Step Over allows you to skip over a line of code or a function call, Step In allows you to step into a ,\n",
    "    function call and inspect its inner workings, and Step Out allows you to quickly return to the calling code without,\n",
    "    stepping through each line of the current function.\n",
    "\n",
    "##10.After you click Continue, when will the debugger stop ?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-.When you click the Continue button in the debugger, the program will resume normal execution and continue running until,\n",
    "    it either completes normally or encounters another breakpoint or exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "    If there are no more breakpoints or exceptions encountered, the program will continue running until it either completes,\n",
    "    all its tasks and exits, or it is interrupted externally (such as by the user pressing Ctrl-C or by an operating system,\n",
    "    signal).\n",
    "\n",
    "    In summary, the debugger will not stop again until one of the following events occurs:\n",
    "\n",
    "    The program reaches another breakpoint\n",
    "    The program encounters an unhandled exception\n",
    "    The program completes all its tasks and exits\n",
    "    The program is interrupted externally\n",
    "\n",
    "##11. What is the concept of a breakpoint?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-.In software development, a breakpoint is a point in the code where the debugger will pause the execution of the program,\n",
    "    allowing the developer to inspect the state of the program and step through the code one line at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Breakpoints are commonly used for debugging purposes, especially when dealing with complex code or hard-to-reproduce bugs.\n",
    "    They allow developers to examine the internal state of the program at a specific point in time, view the values of variables, \n",
    "    and step through the code one line at a time to see how the program executes.\n",
    "\n",
    "    To set a breakpoint, a developer can usually simply click on the line of code where they want the program to pause.\n",
    "    When the program reaches that line, it will pause and wait for the developer to inspect the state of the program and step ,\n",
    "    through the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "    In summary, breakpoints allow developers to pause the execution of the program at a specific point in the code, and inspect,\n",
    "    the state of the program, including variable values, memory locations, and other important information.\n",
    "    This helps developers,identify and fix bugs in their code.\n",
